# Boosting Productivity: Essential Tools For Every UX/UI Designer
Ivana
UX/UI Designer
Working with the right tools makes a difference, no matter your profession. Since one of our specialties at COBE is UX/UI design, in this blog post I’ll talk about the most frequently used tools in our design workflow. Whether you’re more into user experience (UX), or user interface (UI) design – or just trying to balance the two – having the right toolstack is the first requirement for a start. Of course, it’s all about working with tools that suit you (and your team) best and help you in your daily work. Some you probably already know of, and some might sound familiar – nevertheless, sit back and relax while I guide you through our COBE design toolstack!
### Figma
Figma is our go-to everyday tool for UX/UI design (and basically everything else). We work in Figma in all phases of the design process – from concept and creating wireframes to production design and delivering pixel-perfect, development ready screens. Figma has a prototype functionality, which is great when you need to simulate a flow or create a simple animation. My team loves to use it to create presentations as well. What’s special about Figma is also the real-time collaboration between designers, developers and stakeholders involved in the project. And let’s not forget Fig Jam, which comes in handy for anything (literally).
Last but not least, it’s important to give credit to the Figma Community and plugins. Plugins offer a lot of flexibility in your design workflow, help you design more efficiently, and are real life savers. 
At the moment, it counts over 1000 different plugins. Don’t worry, we won’t list all of them. Below are our three personal favourites. Yes, only three. Otherwise we could be writing a book about it.
  1. Content Reel 


We all know how challenging it can get sometimes to find realistic placeholders that will complement the design well enough, right? Content Reel to the rescue! This plugin is like a big content library where you can find photos, texts and icons – basically whatever you need. In case you need custom content for your design, you can even create your own folders and fill them with your own content. Later on, while designing, you can easily add texts and images by selecting a specific frame and applying the plugin. Besides saving time, Content Reel helps you keep consistency and is a good alternative to avoid dummy texts like Lorem Ipsum.
  1. Instance Finder


Instance Finder is a popular Figma plugin that helps you locate component instances in designs. With the help of it, you’re able to quickly search for an instance that needs to be updated or replaced, without doing everything manually. Time-wise, this proved especially useful for large files where one instance appears many times, across multiple design screens and pages. Additionally, you can specify where to search for instances – it’s up to you whether that will be a whole file, one page, or perhaps a single frame. 
  1. Frontitude


Frontitude helps you improve the process of UX writing. It allows you to create copy libraries and one single place for product copy. This way you ensure language consistency, streamline collaboration and increase transparency for everyone involved in the project. Although product copy may not always be your job on the project (depending on the project’s nature and a general agreement with the client), it’s good to know that something like this exists, just in case you need it. It’s available for other design tools as well, not just Figma. So if you’re working with Sketch, for example, you know what to do next.
Other honourable mentions: 
### Around
Aside from Google Meet, Around is another tool we really love to use for our online meetups. It's a perfect tool for calls where you have to do active design work in the background. It allows you to simultaneously work in other tools, such as Figma, without taking up a lot of space on your screen. Instead, your meeting buddies float around in bubbles and are always on display – which makes online interaction a bit more real. It’s also a good choice for those of you who don’t have an external monitor. Last but not least, Around has recently joined forces with another tool we love to use – Miro. Let’s see what this duo has in store for us.
Another bonus point:

### Miro
Miro is an online whiteboard tool which offers a smooth collaboration to remote teams. At COBE, we usually use it for ideation sessions, research and workshops with the clients. What is great about Miro is that it's not a design tool, but rather a blank canvas that offers many possibilities. It comes with a set of built-in templates you can work with.
### After Effects
After Effects is a digital visual effects and video editing tool that comes with the Adobe Creative Cloud licence. We use it mostly to animate icons, illustrations and other vector graphics. Apart from that, this tool is also great for creating videos and other animated content that can bring your marketing activities to another level. All animations you create in After Effects, you can easily use in other apps or transfer to Lottie.
### Lottie
We all know that animations contribute to making your content more engaging and interesting. However, they might slow down the application’s performance. To avoid this, I suggest you use Lottie to optimise SVG based animations made in After Effects. That way, the animation becomes a small, compact .json file that takes up way less memory than the original. It works on any platform and can easily be implemented by developers. With the help of Lottie, animations remain scalable without losing quality and getting pixelated.

### Protopie
Even though prototyping can be done in Figma, if you’re in a need of a more advanced prototype, Protopie is your go-to tool. It’s easy to use and it can help you turn your ideas into realistic, high-fidelity prototypes. With Protopie, you can prototype for different devices and screen sizes – whether it’s a mobile device or a car dashboard screen. In addition, it’s compatible with Figma. With the help of this plugin, designs can be easily exported from Figma to Protopie.

### Linear
Linear is a project management tool that’s specifically designed to help teams track their work and manage any open issues. It provides a simple and intuitive interface which can help your team collaborate, share information and stay on top of each other's work. It also comes with a lot of different customization options and keyboard shortcuts. When it comes to product development, the main tool we use at COBE is JIRA. However, Linear is the first choice for design-only projects or internal management in general.
### Slack
Speaking of communication tools, Slack is probably the one you’re most familiar with. Almost all of our communication at COBE goes through Slack, plus it has some neat features that we can’t go without in our day-to-day work. Slack status, huddles, and integrations with apps like Giphy and Google Calendar are just some of them.
### Other Tools
On top of all the tools that I’ve mentioned at this point, there are some less frequently used, but still worth mentioning. Google Docs and Confluence are great for documenting whatever you need to have documented. Google Sheets as well, for any number-related tasks, such as project estimations. Loom for example, is a handy tool you can use to record testing sessions with users. These tools are not required in our everyday tasks, but can be incredibly useful in certain situations. By the way, there are many more, but I will stop myself here. 
That’s all folks! I hope you enjoyed this blog post and maybe learned something new about the tools you usually work with. I’ll be a happy designer if I’ve motivated you to step out of your comfort zone and try a completely new tool. 🙂

# Agile, Scrum, Kanban - Demystified
Josipa
Product Owner
Calling yourself agile today will instantly rise alerts among the agile community: You’re not agile if you’re not collocated; you never release in the first weeks; you don’t talk face-to-face; you didn’t amaze your customers right away, etc. At COBE, we are a team foremost. What we care about is keeping up the good work and becoming better. Whether we are considered an agile agency or not, we for sure know a lot about this stuff, so let me share the basics with you! :)
### What is agile really about?
Agile is a philosophy, centered around 4 core values and 12 principles. It’s often explained through software development, but it can easily be translated to any industry. Agile core values
  * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  * Working software over comprehensive documentation
  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  * Responding to change over following a plan


‍ I won’t go into principles, as those are centered around values anyway, but if you’re interested, you can find it on the official 
In case you already tried it and you’re still finding yourself confused about the topic, I can only say — it is expected. After all, agile is here to help you with prioritizing what’s more important.
Now that you understand what is agile, let’s get into the two most common “implementations” of it — Kanban and Scrum.
### Kanban
Kanban is technically, a Lean 
Lean is another philosophy just like agile, but focused on different values, although it still aligns with agile in some sense. Lean is really nothing new —it was made up in the late 40s in the Toyota Production System and was initially used in vehicle manufacture.
Lean is a pull system, just-in-time, with one core idea
In pull systems, production is driven by customer demand. Push, on the contrary, is focused on producing as much as possible and then forcing the launch to the market.
So having that in mind, Kanban is a tool designed to maximize value, but also to raise alerts when there is a bottleneck that affects the production. It’s based on a continuous improvement foundation and it’s incremental. Incremental means that the finished work goes into product extension and directly brings value to customers. Continues improvement speaks for itself — the process should evolve to always become better.
### How does it work in action?
The workflow consists of 3 major steps
  1. To do,
  2. Doing, 
  3. Done. 


‍ You’re flexible as long as you keep those steps fixed. For example, we usually separate step “Doing” into “Development progress”, “Development resolution” and “Testing progress”.
For Kanban, it's important to restrict the work in progress, which leads to “waste” control, as you can easily determine the problem when the limit is reached. For example, when you get a red flag on the Done
Image source: 
There are some additional principles, but I won’t go into too much detail. Let me just tell you that Kanban also instructs to start with whatever you have at the very moment and you are free to keep the company roles, responsibilities, leadership structure or current processes.‍
### ‍ Scrum
Scrum is defined as a framework for developing and sustaining complex products. But according to Scrum creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, this is not the whole definition. The whole definition consists of Scrum roles, events and artifacts with the rules that connect everything together.
###  Scrum roles
A Scrum Master, Product Owner and a Development team all form a Scrum team.
The Scrum Master
The Product Owner (PO) 
In practice, it means that the PO selects the most attractive features for the product, based on the market research, stakeholder input, analytics or forecast analysis. Everything needs to be aligned with the product vision.
The Product Owner puts ideas and insights into the format of a user story, into a list called Product backlog
The Development team[Development team at COBE](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services/app-design-agency) Tech would include a designer, Android developer, iOS developer, Backend developer, and Quality assurance engineer. 
Product increment, in this case, is made up of those stories that were done in the current iteration. And the iteration in Scrum is called a Sprint.
### Scrum ceremonies
Sprint planningSprint backlog
Daily Scrum

‍The Sprint review
The Sprint retrospective
###  Scrum artifacts
Scrum artifacts (according to the Scrum Guide by creators) are Product backlog, Sprint backlog and Product increment.
I won’t go into details but let me summarize what we already went through:
The product backlog
A Sprint backlog
The product increment
In some literature, you can find additional Scrum artifacts like Product backlog refinement, Definition of Ready and Done, or Burndown chart — so let’s explain those terms as well.
Product backlog refinement
Image source: 
In a refinement meeting, Scrum teams discuss the stories, values, and effort. In short terms, refinements are important as the team gets the opportunity to prepare the stories for the next iteration.
Definition of ReadyDefinition of Done
Burndown chart
###  Sprint process flow
When I first started talking about Scrum, I explained it as a framework for developing and deploying complex products. This sentence doesn’t tell us much, but the definition also includes Scrum roles, ceremonies, artifacts and the rules explained. Now, let’s check how it’s all connected together in the Scrum process flow.
Image source: 
The Scrum process is organized by iterations, Sprints. Sprint is a time-box period, with a duration of 1 to 4 weeks.
The PO manages the Product backlog to make sure it contains valuable items prioritized by value, and that the stories on top are ready for development by Definition of Ready.
The Sprint starts with Sprint planning, where the PO explains to the Development team what needs to be done and why. The development team then selects the number of stories into the Sprint backlog and commits to finishing it by the end of the iteration. The Development team decides how the stories will be done. 
During the Sprint, the team meets on a daily basis to synchronize the work. Sprint progress is tracked by the Burndown chart. At the end of the Sprint, on the Review meeting, the Development team demonstrates stakeholders what was done during the Sprint, according to Definition of Done. Stakeholders give feedback. Corresponding work gets delivered in the form of the product increment.
The last meeting in the Sprint is Retrospective, in which a team reflects on the process, in order to find space for improvement, and become better.
Everything together is an overview by the Scrum Master, which ensures that the whole process goes smoothly.
###  Simple to understand, hard to master
It’s the Scrum that is known as lightweight in theory but complicated in practice, but I would say it can be translated to any of the methods or methodologies. It’s easy to learn what stands behind each term, but even when you optimistically jump into the process, a lot of things can go wrong. I would say the most common reason for that is sloppy teamwork. 
Let’s be honest, without respect or support among team members and a hardworking community, agile stands no chance. When we, at COBE, figured this out, the sky became the limit. And from that point on any process works like a charm. :)

# 7 Questions You Should Ask Before Hiring an End-to-End Agency
Dolores
Growth Manager
Choosing the right end-to-end agency for your project is a big deal, whether you're launching a new product, redesigning an existing one, or looking for ongoing support. With so many options out there, it can be tough to figure out which agency is the best fit for your needs.
To make your decision a bit easier, we’ve put together a list of key questions to help you address some common concerns and understand the agency’s approach. That way, you can confidently choose a partner that’ll deliver high-quality results and help you achieve your business goals. But, before we move on to the questions, let’s first clear up those common concerns.
### The elephant in the room
It’s natural to have doubts before starting to work with someone new. The best way to avoid surprises? Talk through the usual pain points upfront:
  * Cost and hidden fees‍
  * Deadlines‍
  * Your participation‍
  * Scope changes


Addressing these concerns early can make all the difference when hiring an external agency. Keep reading to find out how you can take action. 
### Getting into the questions 
Choosing the right agency starts with asking the right questions. Why? Because being on the same page from day one can make all the difference. Let’s start. 
#### 1. What sets you apart from other agencies?
This question may seem simple, but it’s crucial for differentiating between agencies that offer similar services. Every agency has something unique to offer, whether it’s their approach, expertise, or company culture
At COBE, we emphasize flexibility, transparency, and a personalized approach based on our extensive experience to each project. This means that we don't follow a one-size-fits-alltailor our strategies to fit your specific needs
Source: giphy.com
#### 2. What’s your experience with projects similar to mine?
Always check if the agency has experience with projects that align with your business goals. This doesn’t necessarily mean they need to have worked in your exact industry
Say you’re building a mobile app for the manufacturing industry. The key question isn’t “Have they built an app for the manufacturing industry before?” but “Do they have experience building technically demanding mobile apps?” Even if it’s in a different industry, their past work will show if they can handle your project. Ask for case studies and examples 
#### 3. How do you approach a project?
Each agency has its own unique process when it comes to handling projects. Understanding their approach will help you determine if their process aligns with your expectations
At COBE, we typically follow agile to ensure flexibility and quick adaptation to changing requirements. More importantly, we prioritize clear communication and collaboration with clients at every stage of the process. So before you make your decision, ask the agency to explain their process in detail, including timelines, milestones, and how they handle revisions or feedback.
#### 4. How do you ensure quality and consistency throughout the project?
Securing that the final product meets your quality standards is essential for the success of any project. Ask the agency about its [quality assurance process](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/every-project-needs-a-strong-quality-assurance-process) and how it maintains consistency across design, development, and testing.
Quality assurance at COBE is strong throughout every phase of the project. Our team of designers, developers, and QA engineers works closely together to ensure the highest standards of design and functionality. We also provide detailed documentation and ongoing testing to ensure the product is functional, user-friendly, and scalable. 
#### 5. How do you handle changes in scope or unexpected challenges during production?
No project is free of challenges. Whether it’s a shift in requirements, scope changes, or unforeseen obstacles, it’s important to know how the agency will handle these situations. Some agencies may be flexible and adaptable, while others may insist on sticking rigidly to the original plan, potentially causing delays and frustration.
Make sure the agency has a clear approach for managing scope changes
#### 6. Who owns the final product?
The ownership of the final product is something that’s often overlooked, but it’s super important when working with an agency. You need to be clear about who owns the design, code, and any other assets
We believe in full transparency and make it a point to ensure our clients own everything we produce. This includes design, code, and documentation. It's vital to have this defined upfront, especially if you ever want to switch agencies or make changes to the product in the future.
#### 7. How do you handle post-launch support and maintenance?
One of the most important questions to ask any agency is how it manages post-launch support and maintenance
Some agencies will offer this as part of their service, while others may expect you to manage maintenance on your own or work with another agency. Be clear about the level of support you can expect after launch
### Pick me, choose me, love me?
When it comes to certain projects, having a single team handle everything can make the biggest difference. An [end-to-end agency](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/use-cases) offers a full range of services, from the initial design and development stages to post-launch support and maintenance. This is ideal for businesses without in-house teams or those that prefer a single team to manage the entire project.
At COBE, we provide a fully integrated approach, making sure your product meets your exact needs while also maintaining flexibility throughout the process. We understand that every client is different, so we customize our approach to fit your goals and provide support every step of the way.
If you have any questions about the topic, feel free to reach out – I’ll be glad to answer them.

# Customer Loyalty Programs: The Importance & the Role of UX Design
Verena
Marketing Manager
In today's fast-changing business world, building customer loyalty is crucial. With the rise of e-commerce, social media, and other digital platforms, customers have more choices than ever, making it increasingly challenging for businesses to sustain their interests. This is where customer loyalty programs step in. In this blog post, we’ll explore how they can help businesses retain customers and boost their engagement and satisfaction levels.
Personalized offers, exclusive discounts, and unique customer experiences are just some of the targeted measures that bind customers to the company emotionally, encouraging them to repeat their purchases. On top of that, these programs also help collect valuable data and insights into customer behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns.
The first step in developing a successful loyalty program is providing a high-quality user experience. To create engaging, personalized, and easy-to-use programs, nothing is more important than good UX Design. If you’re still not convinced, continue reading and discover how loyalty programs can transform your business. 
### Why are customer loyalty programs more important than ever?
Investing in a customer loyalty program pays off, and businesses that do so are seeing positive results. In fact, studies have shown that customers are more drawn to brands that offer loyalty programs over those that don’t. Also, loyalty program members are more likely to recommend the brand to their friends and family, leading to increased customer acquisition and retention. Here are just some of the reasons to start rewarding your customers.
  1. Increased competition 
  2. Rising customer expectation 
  3. Positive revenue impact
  4. Buying incentives 
  5. Customer feedback ‍
  6. Data collection 


### Why is good UX design essential for customer loyalty programs?
When it comes to designing customer loyalty programs, it's all about putting the user experience first. With the right UX design, you’ll encourage customers to actually use the program by making them feel valued and remembered. A poor UX design, on the other hand, can result in customers not using the program at all. Customer loyalty programs should be intuitive and easy to use, give the users a quick overview of the program's benefits, and add overall value. 
Let's not forget the cherry on top – personalization! Customers want offers tailored to their individual needs. Therefore, every good UX design should offer this customization, leveraging the customer’s purchasing history to provide personalized offers. What’s in it for you, you might ask. Well, here are just some of the benefits for your business:
  1. Increased engagement
  2. Improved customer experience 
  3. Increased loyalty 
  4. Differentiation 


So, if you want to create a rewarding relationship with your customer, prioritize the user experience. A well-designed loyalty program can help you increase customer satisfaction, engagement, and retention rates. Not to mention that it can create a positive emotional connection with customers, leading to increased brand loyalty, customer advocacy, and ultimately, revenue growth.
### Which design elements should you focus on?
A well-designed loyalty application can make all the difference when it comes to engaging customers and increasing sales. Here are some of the key design elements that keep your UX design fresh in a competitive market:
  1. Simplicity 
  2. Personalization 
  3. Consistency 
  4. Visual Design 


### Conclusion
In today's competitive market, businesses shouldn’t overlook the importance of customer loyalty programs and smart UX design. By investing in good UX design, you can increase engagement and build stronger relationships with your customers. A well-designed loyalty program can be a powerful tool for retaining customers and driving revenue, and it all starts with a focus on the user experience. An engaging UX design is essential for creating loyalty programs that are responsive, easy to use, and personalized for the customer.

# 8 Years at COBE and Still Evolving
Katarina
Marketing Lead
Looking over the last decade, our company has changed quite a bit – from branding and services we offer to projects and clients we work with. But one thing remains the same – the people. Well, at least two of them. 😅
Now, what would a 10-year celebration be without mentioning those who made it happen? Norina and I had the pleasure to sit down with the two colleagues who have been at COBE the longest and find out what stands behind their loyalty. 
Meet Felix and Mladen! Felix, best known and further addressed as MenzMladen
Today, they’re making sure that everything runs smoothly, but what did it look like when they first started? 
Menz, what’s your first memory of COBE? Do you remember your first day? 
  * To be completely honest, I don’t remember the very first day, but what I do remember perfectly is my job interview! To this day, I still get made fun of for my outfit choice back then. In my head, I was thinking I’m coming for a job interview, so I need to dress up nicely… or at least decent. So I wore a salmon-colored shirt and white jeans (keep in mind this was 2014). I know there’s nothing wrong with that outfit, but style-wise, when I met the guys, I immediately didn’t fit in. Luckily, I had skills to show and a similar sense of humor, so they somehow overlooked my outfit. 


Mladen, what about you? What did the beginnings in Osijek look like? 
  * My first memory of COBE is getting lunch with the managing director in Osijek at that time, asking me and a few of my colleagues to join him at this “small German agency that’s just starting out.” As usual, the beginning was a little messy, but soon we found an office, and the first project we were working on was Kickbase (which is my favorite project to this day). I didn’t meet the bosses from Munich until Christmas time, the same year. I remember not knowing what to expect from them, but our first encounter **exceeded all my expectations** – they were refreshing, approachable, and very open. 


You started your career at COBE as an iOS developer, right? How did your role change over the years? 
  * That’s right, I started off as an iOS developer with about three years of experience and a team of three people. The team varied over the years; some people left, new people came. The only constant in the iOS team was me, which naturally lead me to the iOS lead position. In 2019, I also became part of the management team, and **in 2021 I took an even bigger step** and added the Finance Manager role to my job description. A developer in the finance department? How does that happen? Fun fact, I have a degree in economics, and before I began my development career, I actually worked in finance.


Menz, your first role was a UX Concepter, and today, you’re one of the Managing Directors. How did your responsibilities change over the course of the last eight years to lead you where you are today? 
  * When I first started in 2014, I was mainly busy with taking requirements from customers apart, analyzing them, looking for gaps or open questions, and translating all of that into concepts. With time, I started including prototyping and sales into my daily work, and then in 2020, I also began taking care of finances. I have a minor in business administration, and a background in computer science, so the whole topic of numbers and technology isn’t unknown to me. In the meantime, I was also promoted to UX Director, and then, **beginning of this year to the Managing Director role**.


Since you already mention Daniel and Felix, how would you describe your relationship with our founders? 
  * I’d say we always had a close relationship. They encouraged my growth over the years, respected my opinions, and always included me in big decisions. I mean, they even trusted me with the Managing Director role. So after we got over the whole “salmon-shirt-at-the-job-interview-incident”, everything ran pretty smoothly. 


Mladen, what about you? Your situation differs a bit since you haven’t been working that closely with them, especially in the beginning. 
  * To be completely honest, **one of the things I value most about COBE** is the relationship I have with the founders, their openness, and transparency. Daniel and Felix radiated trust from the very first moment I met them, and that feeling just grew stronger over the years. It influenced every aspect of work that came later. I think they instilled a mindset of teamwork and culture that we all continue to nurture to this day. 


Would you say that culture is one of the main reasons you’re still here? 
  * Yes, definitely. I’ve met a lot of people in COBE over the last eight years and I’ve grown fond of many of them. Each person here brings something new to the table and shares a similar motivation and drive. Another thing that makes our culture special is that every opinion matters – you can always propose an idea or a change. Nothing is really set in stone.


Menz, what about you? What draws you to stay?
  * I also love the culture, of course, but the thing I thrive on is responsibility. From the very beginning, my opinion mattered and I had lots of opportunities to re-shape already existing processes and also introduce new ones. This is something that hasn't changed in the last eight years and was always supported by the founders. 


What do you guys think is the biggest difference between COBE eight years ago and today? 
  * I think we can both agree that, compared to the beginning, we are professionals today. The initial chaos has given way to structure. **We have also really grown** – the number of colleagues alone has increased tenfold. And last but not least, the profitability has improved significantly.


Menz, did you ever think COBE would be here 10 years later?
  * **Absolutely YES!** Everyone on our team is extremely motivated and has what it takes to lead us where we are today. Of course, there were ups and downs, but I never thought that COBE could fail.


And what about the Osijek office? Mladen?
  * If I’m being completely transparent with you, at one point, I didn’t know what would happen. But luckily, we pulled through and in the last three years, I’ve seen immense progress. Sometimes, the results we get today catch me completely off guard. I have to stop and ask myself **“Are we really here now?”** All in all, it’s a good feeling.


Would you say that the company’s progress influenced your personal development too?
  * Yes, of course. I always say how it’s not just COBE that has changed, but I changed too. I think all of us did, and it would be strange if it was any other way. As I’ve mentioned earlier, I’ve met a lot of people working here, and they all influenced both my professional and personal growth. 


Menz, what about you? 
  * Since the topic of mindfulness has become an integral part of my life through COBE, I would say it has also had **a positive influence on my private life**. Personally, I learned a lot about myself through the opportunities and responsibilities COBE offered me. It made me constantly work on myself and I don’t think I’d be where I am today without COBE. 


As one of the Managing Directors, can you share any future plans for COBE? What can we expect?
  * Well, one of the plans for the future, which we already started working on, is broadening our services. Usually, the action starts when there’s already an idea of a specific digital product, but we want to offer a consulting part at the beginning too. We just brought a colleague who is setting up the Business Innovation area on board, so it’s slowly kicking off. 


Mladen, do you like what you hear? Can you envision yourself at COBE in another eight years? 
  * For sure! As the company evolves, it allows us to evolve with it. I feel like, if in a year from now, I decided to completely change direction, and become a Project Manager, for instance, I could do it, and still stay at COBE. So yes, I do see myself here.


Menz, looking back over your time here and all the cool memories you collected over the years, is there a special moment you’d like to highlight?
  * Again, I think we can both agree that the **Summer trip in 2017** was amazing. It was our first team building as one team and it was the first time the whole team, both Munich and Osijek, met in person. 


Anything to add, Mladen?
  * I completely agree with Menz. But aside from team buildings and Christmas parties, I’d highlight the **Zlatna Kuna** award we received for the most successful small company in the Osijek-Baranja County, based on our financial results. When you work with numbers daily, sometimes you don’t see the growth until someone else points it out for you. So this was a nice, objective reminder of how far we’ve come. 


Thank you both for sharing your stories, it has certainly been an interesting ride. Even though the last eight years might have passed by in the blink of an eye, everything you’ve done, and you’re still doing, has certainly left a mark on the COBE we have today.
Here’s to another (at least) eight years of growth, fun, and success. 🥂 We can’t wait to hear new stories from you!‍

# The Story Behind Your Favorite App - Azil Osijek
Katarina
Marketing Lead
In 2021, I’m pretty sure you’re already familiar with Azil Osijek, the only dog adoption app in Croatia. But do you know the story behind it? Who came up with the app? No? Keep reading, we’ll tell you everything. 
### Introduction to Azil Osijek
Let’s go back to 2017 when we first started working on the app. Azil Osijek 
Our main goal with it was to grow awareness amongst people and increase the number of dog adoptions. That’s why we created an easy-to-use app, dividing dogs into different categories, and telling their stories - don’t worry, it doesn’t just say “woof woof”. 
### How did we come up with the idea?
The idea for the app came from a team that was at that time working at COBE - we’re talking about 2016 here. During one of their many visits to the dog shelter, they figured they don't even know how many dogs Azil has, what their names are or how they even ended up in the shelter. So the next logical step was to arrange a meeting with Azil and show them the idea for ​​the app. The first meeting went smoothly and we were all very happy to start the new project. After all, the guys at the dog shelter were getting a free app, and we got a new project.
### First release
The first version of the app came out in 2017 and was welcomed with great joy. The dogs were categorized by gender, height, and age, and the users could easily check if the dog they want to adopt is still available. Furthermore, we introduced pet-friendly places in Osijek into the app, plus an info desk with all the information about the dog shelter and Udruga Pobjede
Honestly, it feels like every one of our employees has worked on this app at some point, which is why Azil Osijek
  * Azil Osijek was the first project I’ve worked on, so I’ll cherish it forever. I haven't studied medicine, but with this project, I was working on something that could save lives (or close enough). Cheesy quote alert: You can’t buy love, but you can adopt. Or at least make an app that will increase the chances of adoption. With Azil Osijek we want to leave a positive impact on the community, and this is something we value in COBE, 


### Second release
We received a lot of positive feedback on Google Store with high ratings and more than a thousand downloads with the first release. Due to a large number of satisfied users, we decided to continue working on the app to [improve the user experience](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services/ux-research-agency) and ensure as much adoption as possible. Because of that, we decided to update the app in 2020 and we can't be happier with the outcome.
  * Working on the new version of the app was especially interesting because it shone in a completely new light. **We replaced the existing design** with a new, modern, and interesting one including numerous images and animations. In this version, we have added an option to edit existing comments on posts, and instead of likes, users can leave a paw on each post 🐾. Like the rest of the app, the filter for pet-friendly places and dogs has been given a new look, making it even easier for users to find their favorite puppy. In addition to the complete redesign, we gave users the ability to log in to the digital world of the dog shelter via Facebook or Google accounts. We have also added an Info desk screen where they can see all the details about the association that takes care of the dogs. I hope that the new look of the app will attract even more users and that they will enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed developing it, Luka


You can see what the app looks like below, although it's better to install it and see it yourself. And no worries, the app is completely free.
A little sneak peek 
### ‍ Now it's your turn!
We think that it's very important to work on projects that can change the world (or at least a town), and the Azil Osijek
Thanks to the growing awareness of citizens and the number of volunteers, the dog shelter of Osijek has become the most beautiful one in Croatia
So

# Why Every Project Needs a Strong Quality Assurance Process
Katarina
Quality Assurance Lead
Quality Assurance (QA) is a part of your everyday life, even if you don’t always realize it. Think about sending an important email – you likely read it over a few times to catch typos and make sure it makes sense. Or, when buying a car, you most likely take it for a test drive to check the brakes, lights, and engine before committing.
The same principle applies to digital products. Integrating QA into the development process ensures high quality, prevents major issues, and ensures a smooth user experience. Simply put, QA is the last line of defense before a product reaches its users.
Skipping QA comes with significant risks, including financial loss and a poor user experience, which can harm both the company developing the product and the client. On top of that, a lack of QA can damage a company’s reputation, lead to user loss, and trigger negative feedback. Even 
### The value of QA
Integrating QA early in the development process brings a lot of perks: 
  1. Saves time and money
  2. Reduces risks of defects
  3. Prevents bugs from reaching end users
  4. Ensures stable, working software
  5. Avoids low-quality app releases


It also improves user experience by preventing crashes, fixing non-working features, enhancing usability and app intuitiveness, and ensuring smooth performance and accessibility. All of these contribute to a stable, user-friendly product 
If you already have a product but didn’t introduce QA from the beginning, let me tell you, it’s never too late to start. The approach will vary depending on the product's complexity, but the key is to tailor the plan to the client's needs. This starts with identifying pain points, reviewing current processes, and creating a step-by-step plan to integrate QA
### How does QA help reduce long-term costs?
QA helps cut costs in the long run by ensuring that your product is stable and works as intended. Addressing issues early on, during the requirement reviews or initial testing stages, is much cheaper than fixing bugs in the later stages. 
Now, you might be wondering how exactly QA helps reduce costs, so let’s break it down: 
  * Saving time and resources: 
  * Preventing damage to customer satisfaction
  * Avoiding legal costs
  * Minimizing downtime


### Clearing up the confusion 
QA is often overlooked, but skipping it can mean serious risks and lost potential. Here are the most common misconceptions:
  * QA slows down development: 


  * Anyone can do QA:


  * QA guarantees a bug-free app:[manual and automated testing](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/from-manual-to-automated-testing-tailoring-qa-to-your-needs) have their limitations. The goal is to minimize risk and deliver the best possible user experience.


Quality isn’t just a digital concern; it’s something customers expect in every industry. If you don’t deliver, they’ll just go somewhere else. However, despite this, QA often gets overlooked, especially when deadlines are tight. The problem? These short-term savings often lead to long-term losses. And the risks? Poor user experience, critical bugs slipping through to end users, lost revenue, increased costs from post-release fixes, and even long-term damage to your company’s reputation.
### QA as a smart investment
Whether you're a startup or an established company, making it in today’s highly competitive market takes more than just innovation – it requires quality. If you don’t have a smooth UX, your reputation could take a hit, leading to financial losses and a weakened brand. Investing in QA is really investing in your business’s future.
It also plays a crucial role in security. There’s a specialized branch of quality assurance dedicated to security testing, ensuring vulnerabilities are caught and addressed before they become serious threats. This way, you would stay compliant with security standards and regulations, which is crucial for protecting sensitive databuilding user trust
### How to implement it effectively?
The approach to QA varies depending on the size of your business. Startups typically focus on getting to market quickly with an MVP, prioritizing speed over extensive testing, while mid-sized companies have more resources to invest in stability, ensuring their product is polished and reliable.
Regardless of the size of your business, the most important thing is to start testing as early as possible. Instead of waiting for a feature to be built, reviewing requirements upfront will help catch potential issues early. Automation also plays a key role here – implementing tests where they add value, such as for regression testing, can significantly speed up your development process. When developers write unit tests, they can catch mistakes before the code even reaches the QA team, while automated end-to-end tests help reduce repetitive manual work. 
Think about fast feedback loops as well; testing small chunks of work instead of waiting for large feature sets enables quicker fixes, lowering costs, and minimizing delays.
### Ready to put quality first?
If you’re just starting to prioritize QA, your first step is to create a solid strategy. Develop a clear plan, identify critical areas, and take small, incremental steps to build a strong QA process.
Remember, small wins lead to long-term success. A well-executed QA strategy ensures smoother development, reduces costly post-release fixes, and sets your business up for sustainable growth.

# Dependency Injection in Swift Using Property Wrappers
Bruno
Mobile Developer
*Before we get started, note that it’s required to have some basic knowledge of closures and generics for this article.
Trying to find an optimal way of injecting services around the codebase isn't a new topic. Developers attempted to do it in numerous ways – either by using singletons around the app or by making a service factory and passing an instance of that factory around. Now, having a lot of singletons isn't a great idea, and the service factory pattern forces you to write the name of services numerous times – something which I, personally, despise. But what if I told you there was a way to write a minimum amount of code that's easy to maintain and test, and isn't hard to improve or adapt?
Say hello to dependency injection with property wrappers!
### What's the deal with dependency injection and services?
Dependency injection is a design pattern achieved by designing your code in a way that your objects or functions receive objects that they depend on, instead of creating their own
```
classViewModel{privatevar:ServiceAprivatevar:ServiceBprivatevar:ServiceCinit(:ServiceA,:ServiceB,:ServiceC){self.=self.=self.=}}
```

### What are property wrappers?
Property wrappers have been added in Swift 5.1 and as their name suggests, they provide some functionalities around other values. Think of them as property observers (like willSet or didSet) on steroids. They can be used to autocapitalize string properties, or clamp numeric values inside a certain range. You've most definitely worked with them if you ever used SwiftUI. Wrappers like @State@Binding@AppStorage
```
structContentView:View{@StateObjectvar=ViewModel()@AppStorage(""isLoggedIn"")privatevar:Bool=false@Stateprivatevar=""""
    @Stateprivatevar=""""

    @FocusStatevar:Field?var:someView{VStack{Text(""Login"")// other content}}}
```

In this article you will learn how to use property wrappers to achieve dependency injection that looks like this:
```
classNewViewModel{@Serviceprivatevar:ServiceA@Serviceprivatevar:ServiceB@Serviceprivatevar:ServiceCinit(){}}
```

### The real deal
So here's the idea. We won’t make a service factory, nor store our services inside of a container. We’ll store the way we create our service
#### Step #1: Service Types
During an app development, you would most often find two types of services inside your app. Ones that should persist throughout the lifetime of your app – singletons
```
enumServiceType{casecasecasecase}
```

For ease of use, providing an automatic
#### Step #2: Service Container
The main idea behind a service container is storing previously created services and the way they are built. That’s why we need a cache of services and a dictionary of closures that generate our services. So inside a class called ServiceContainer
```
privatestaticvar:[String:()->Any]=[:]privatestaticvar:[String:Any]=[:]
```

The reason why we're using strings as dictionary keys is because services will be recognized by their type names. Now that we have somewhere to cache and store our services, we need a way to register them. Here's how you can do it:
```
staticfuncregister<Service>(:Service.Type,_:@autoclosure@escaping()->Service){[String(:.self)]=}
```

Notice the @autoclosureServiceContainer.register(MyServiceProtocol.self, MyService())MyService(){ MyService() }
Let's get to resolving services. The syntax will start looking a bit crazy right about now, so let's clarify it a bit. Our key is a string describing our type, aka the name of our service. Then, depending on what type of a service we want, we either create one from the dictionary of closures or return a cached one – if we want a singleton. We're also using generics here, hence why we're casting it to our type Service. Generics, in combination with type inference, are a bliss. 
```
staticfuncresolve<Service>(_:ServiceType=.,_:Service.Type)->Service?{let=String(:.self)switch{case.:iflet=[]as?Service{return}else{let=[]?()as?Serviceiflet={[]=}return}case.:let=[]?()as?Serviceiflet={[]=}returncase.:fallthroughcase.:return[]?()as?Service}}
```

Feel free to add other types of dependencies and modify the resolve function to meet your needs. There's still a catch! If we don't find a service, we return nil.
#### Step #3: The Property Wrapper
Property Wrappers in Swift are structs annotated with the @propertyWrapper
Now that we have a functioning service container, we can extract the service we want from it by using generics. Our whole property wrapper will be using generics and that’s how we’ll know which service to extract from the container. In the initializer of the property wrapper, we try extracting the service type. If it fails, well, it’s the developer’s fault - don’t forget to register that service type!
```
@propertyWrapperstructService<Service>{var:Serviceinit(_:ServiceType=.){guardlet=ServiceContainer.resolve(,Service.self)else{let=String(:Service.self)fatalError(""No service of type \(serviceName) registered!"")}self.=}var:Service{get{self.}mutatingset{=}}}
```

You’ll have to be careful if you have a service depending on another service. In other words, if you have ServiceA depending on ServiceB, you’ll have to register ServiceB before registering ServiceA.
Now, notice the mutating setter of the wrappedValue. If you were to only read data from your service, you wouldn’t need to add a setter at all, but there might be some fields you want to modify later on. Think of an image caching service – you need to be able to save an image somewhere.
#### Step #4: @Service in action
Before you start using the @ServicedidFinishLaunchingWithOptions
```
@mainstructServicesDIApp:App{init(){setupServiceContainer()}var:someScene{WindowGroup{ContentView()}}}privateextensionServicesDIApp{funcsetupServiceContainer(){ServiceContainer.register(:ServiceA.self,ServiceA())ServiceContainer.register(:ServiceB.self,ServiceB())ServiceContainer.register(:ServiceC.self,ServiceC())}}
```

Now, on to the @Service
#### 1) Services passed as initializer parameters
If you used proper dependency injection techniques, you are familiar with having numerous parameters for class/struct initializers. The most common case in app development is instantiating view models. Well, when using @Service@Service
If you worked on a complex project that dealt in some other way with services and dependency injection, you probably stumbled upon service protocols that your service classes implement. It’s usually a good practice to depend on protocols instead of concrete class implementations since services deal with complex functionalities. If you want to continue that practice, you can pass a protocol type as the first parameter when registering your service. Just make sure to type-annotate your member variables as service protocols, not services themselves. Otherwise you can remove that parameter if you want to.
Using @Service@Service
```
classNetworkService{funcfetchData(){// implementation}}classWeatherDataService{@Serviceprivatevar:NetworkServiceinit(){}funcsomeMethod(){.fetchData()}}
```

And that’s it, you’re good to go! Notice the amount of code we removed! That’s one of the reasons why I switched to using property wrappers!
#### 2) Services used in method bodies
Sometimes when you’re writing extensions to Swift’s types, you need access to some of your services – for example, when you’re implementing translations inside your app. Let’s say you have a TranslationService that translates any given string to the language you want. To translate a string to another language you could make a computed property that calls the TranslationService and provides you with the appropriate translation. Since property wrappers also work on local variables, you can easily use them inside method bodies, and in this case get access to a TranslationService without a problem.
```
extensionString{var:String{@Servicevar:TranslationService@Servicevar:UserSettingsServicelet=.return.translate(:self,:)}}
```

### To summarize
Property wrappers are a really powerful feature in Swift that can be used for dependency injection. They also help you maintain code quality, testability and readability. 
If you want to see @Service
I encourage you to experiment with implementing dependency injection using @Service

# 7 Things You Can Learn About Business and Life From Kids
Danijela
Product Owner Lead
Even if you’re not a parent, I'm sure you already know that children can teach you a lot about life – whether it's about communication, honesty, or emotions. Ever since my school years, all through college, and 15 years of work experience, I’ve seen a lot of situations where people tend to complicate simple things, hide their emotions, and are afraid to stand up for themselves. This is when we should stop and ask ourselves: “Why do we tend to overcomplicate things when there are simple solutions?”
Before we get into that, let me introduce you to the core idea of this article. While I was preparing breakfast one Sunday morning, my sons were standing nearby, discussing which game they’ll play today. We have a rule at our home that each day one of them chooses the game, and that day, it was my younger son's turn to pick. Even though my older son knew it wasn't his turn, he said ""We should play this one"", pointing to one of the boxes. His younger brother immediately reacted with ""No, today is my turn.""
I wasn't surprised by my older son's courage – of course, he tried to get his own way. However, I didn't expect the openness and the way my younger son would decline his suggestion. For him, it wasn’t that much about the game, but about his right to be the one that picks the game. Another thing that caught my attention was the reaction
Now, let's try applying this scenario to a different situation, in which there would be two adults at their workplace. When it comes to openness,  reaction
Afterward, I continued linking the way my children communicate with some adult-world situations and that's when things got even more interesting. Continue reading to get more tips that will help you simplify your adulthood. 
### 1. Be honest
Yes, it's that simple. You don’t like it? Say it. If you don’t believe in what you or someone else is doing or how things are being done, you should address it. Think about it like this – what’s the worst thing that can happen? 
If you're worried that someone might get offended or that you might lose respect and support, let me tell you this. People will respect you more if you're being honest, even if they disagree with you. However, don’t forget to be kind
If you’re still worried this won’t work for you, try saying it to yourself first. Write it down and read it out loud, imagining someone else said it to you. Are you offended? No? Great, let’s move on then. 
### 2. Express your emotions
Throwing toys at your colleagues is not what I’m suggesting, but being quiet when something’s wrong or playing it cool is also not a healthy way to go through life. Nobody has 365 ultra-happy days in a year. There are bad days as well, and that's totally fine. 
You might’ve heard that talking about your emotions at the workplace is not professional and that you should leave it somewhere aside, maybe in a drawer at home. 🤷‍♀️ But, considering an average adult spends more time with his colleagues than with his family, having healthy relationships with them is crucial. Think of a child who would simply say “I'm happy” or “I'm sad”. I know this sounds rudimentary, but when it comes to emotions, it's way more advanced than how many adults communicate.
Keep in mind that when there is something wrong, for most people it can be pretty hard to hide. Even without speaking, you might be sending out negative nonverbal signals. And we want to avoid that. Saying what bothers you out loud will make you feel better anyway, so why wouldn’t you do it? In the end, if you work with great people as I do, they’ll do anything to help you. And if they’re the cause of a specific issue, then it's even more important to talk to them because it might lead to finding a mutual solution.
Note to yourself – don’t forget to show positive emotions as well. It's highly unlikely one can show too much
### 3. Negotiate like a kid
You'll probably agree with me that kids are little masters of negotiation. Even though they probably won't get something the second they ask for it, they’ll also not give up so easily. They tend to be persuasive and persistent: “I can’t get that chocolate? Well, can I get it if I tidy up my room? Still no? Can I, at least, get a candy bar then?” 
You see where I am going, so let's apply this to the adult-life scenario. Maybe you want to get promoted at work? Start a new project? Get a new desk? What exactly is stopping you from asking? Just go for it. Even if you don’t get what you want, you’ll at least know the reason and learn what you can do in order to get it. 
### 4. Dream big
Have you ever heard a kid saying “I want to be an astronaut, but it's too hard to become one?” No? Me neither. Why is that? Well, kids are focused on success only, not on the troubles that may appear along the way. Of course, this isn’t the most realistic way to live, but if you really think about it, there are no safe wins in life, so why not try and shoot for the stars? 
Adults develop fear through their life experiences, that’s normal, and I’m not saying we should suppress it. But, if you’re thinking about doing something big, I suggest putting on paper everything that could go wrong with your plan first. Then, if you figure out you’re not losing too much (or nothing at all), I say go for it.
### 5. Work hard, play hard
If you're an average adult, it's possible that, at some point in your life, you stopped playing games. Unless you're working in a digital agency, then the fun never stops. But, if it did, why did it happen? Do work and fun really have to be on the opposite side? Maybe it’s because we think that if we're having fun while working, we won’t get the results we want. We might even be worried that people won’t take us seriously. 
Many research results show that happy employees perform better than the ones who are not. Motivation and satisfaction overall have a great impact on one’s performance. Knowing this, make sure that, besides focusing on doing a great job, you find some time to have fun too. Wake that inner child up! Try finding joy in your everyday tasks and look for creativity in unexpected places. Or, if you’re an adult that still enjoys playing games, like most of us here, play them with your colleagues. Organize a board game night, play fantasy football, go to squash – find whatever works for you best, and boost that team spirit. 
### 6. Communicate expectations clearly
As adults, we often assume that people know what we're expecting from them, even though we don’t say it out loud. On the other hand, kids don’t assume – if they want something, they’ll say it. Imagine if the whole world worked like that. Unfortunately, it doesn’t, and most of the time you have to read someone’s body language or analyze the tone of their voice to conclude how they feel. This isn’t something you, alone, can change, but remember that the change starts with you first. So before speaking to someone, always evaluate if you're being clear enough.
If you see space for improvement in that department, there are ways to do it. For example, taking meeting notes and sending follow-up emails containing the most important information saved my life. But if you’re not a big fan of writing, you can also confirm everything you just agreed on in the meeting verbally.
### 7. Break the rules, fail often, and learn from mistakes 
As a parent, you want your child to evolve in many different ways. But, if they fully obey the rules, how are they supposed to learn? Sometimes, it's better to let them explore things themselves and make mistakes. And the same goes for adults. 
Re-evaluate the rules we stick to every day – just because something is donein a specific way
Going through this article, I realized that, while growing up, we made lives unnecessarily complicated for ourselves in order to be liked, understood, and accepted. Yet when you’re a child, everything seems simple and easy-going. I know they say adults have it all figured out, but maybe it’s the other way around. This is why we should always listen to our children. Yeah, we’re teaching them about life, but we can learn from them so much too.

# App Clips and Instant Apps: Tailored Experiences at Lightning Speed
Leo
UX/UI Designer
Apps are the standard for offering good digital products and experiences on smartphones. However, due to their download size and the requirement to install them through the app store, there’s a significant barrier to entry compared to simply opening a website link – especially when things need to be done quickly.
Apple and Google have recognized this issue and offer solutions for their smartphone operating systems, called ""App Clips"" on iOS and ""Instant Apps"" on Android, often referred to collectively as “Mini Apps"". Despite their similarities, they have important differences that must be considered before the design and development phase. 
After reading this article, you’ll know how they differ from one another and find out if they could be helpful for your next project. 
‍
### The Edge of Native Apps in Complex Interactions
Let's start from the beginning: why are apps often preferred over websites or progressive web apps (PWAs)?
Due to their native programming, apps often have better performance than websites, especially when it comes to animations or more complex interactions, such as with maps. Screens don’t need to be completely reloaded during navigation or interaction, as they’re already stored in the device's memory. Only dynamic content needs to be updated from the server, leading to none or minimal loading times during navigation through the app. This allows the users to move through the app more quickly and smoothly, improving the user experience.
### Mini-Apps: Lowering the Barrier to User Adoption
For these reasons, apps have often been blindly accepted as the obvious way in our industry. However, when you look at the process required prior to using them, specifically compared to websites, it quickly becomes apparent that the users have to be very convinced of an app before they even install it:
  1. The app must be opened in the app store
  2. On the go, users often have to sacrifice a lot of valuable data to download and install the app (at least in Germany it’s that way)
  3. After the download, the setup process can become tedious and annoying, through permission requests, GDPR agreements, and sometimes unavoidable logins


There are often alternative ways to reach a goal that are already well established and sometimes even easier to access. For example, a website would’ve already been loaded when you have just opened an app’s store page (after which it’s necessary to take two more steps to even use it). Or, take a look at the use case of purchasing a train ticket – apps compete with established ticket machines, which are easily accessible on every platform. Therefore, you can see that app installations are one of the most critical points in the user journey.
This is where Apple and Google's Mini Apps come in: they’re small, open as quickly as a website, but offer the UX of a native app without the need for an explicit installation. Due to the limitation of their download size to 10-15 mb, they must focus on a very specific use case and can only provide the necessary content of their underlying app, such as purchasing a train ticket. Keep in mind that these interactions shouldn’t require logging in. In the following section, I’ll explain the key features and differences of their implementations on Android and iOS platforms.
### App Clips vs Instant Apps: Understanding the Key Differences
Initially, the similarities: As the name Mini App
#### However, even though they behave similarly at a first glance, there are also important differences to consider when developing mini-apps: 
Instant Apps are the older format and have a stronger focus on gaming – but are not limited to it. They can be accessed through QR codes, URLs, suggestions in Google search results or the Play Store page of the main app through a ""Try now"" button. This also reflects the intended use case for Google's Instant Apps. They aim to act as a preview of the full app. According to Google's UX guidelines, the screens available in the Instant App are directly mirrored in the app, including the app’s navigation. If the user is interested in content that’s not included in the Instant App, they should be referred to download the full app.
Apple, on the other hand, is taking a slightly different approach with App Clips: their goal is to make the select functionality as quickly available as possible. The focus lies on offering the best experience for a specific context. This means that you can entirely adapt the usage and structure of an App Clip to the context of its’ use and that it doesn't necessarily have to be based on the structure of the underlying app, as it is the case for Instant Apps. The conceptual focus of App Clips on specific contexts of use is also reflected in the ways they can be discovered and accessed. Just like with Instant Apps, this is possible through QR codes and URLs, but also through associated places in Apple Maps or location-based Siri suggestions. Since the main app is opened if it’s installed, the App Clip’s functionality must be fully present in the main app, too.
In addition to their basic structure, there’s another essential difference in the behavior of the two variants on the smartphone. After use, Instant Apps are not accessible from the home screen. They may still be in the overview of opened apps, but closing an Instant App is more comparable to closing a tab. Nobody can guarantee that the Instant App will be in the same state in which it was left once you reopen it. App Clips, on the other hand, are accessible in the iOS App Gallery 
### What does this mean for the future of apps?
While Mini Apps solve many of the disadvantages of apps, they cannot and will not replace regular apps. This is primarily due to their technical nature, as they can’t be published without a host app. Additionally, due to their size restrictions and limited lifespan, they don’t fulfill the requirements to host many of the established interactions. Instead, they should be seen as a demo and an ideal advertising space for the full app. With quick access, users can use selected functions without much friction. In the end, the goal is still to download the main app.
### Key Takeaways
Mini Apps lower the barrier of entry to the level of a website visit for using a service. With clever and contextually meaningful access points, using them feels simple and natural. The subsequent user experience is similar to the unbeatable standard of a native app, but is completely focused on achieving a specific goal. 
Once the user realizes the quality of the service and decides to use the Mini App, the next step – downloading – comes pretty easily. This is supported on both platforms by specific call-to-actions to download the app from the store, which can be placed in various places within the Mini Apps.
In the conception phase, you must take into account the differences between the formats on Android and iOS, as they may require differences in implementations.

# Accessible UX Writing: Microcopy, Alt-Text, and Screen Readers
Adrian
UX/UI Designer
When designing for accessibility, the visual aspects often take center stage, but there’s a lot more to it than meets the eye. Imagine what would happen to a digital product if we removed all text – even for a person who can access this product without any barriers, the screen would immediately turn into a chaotic mess. On the other hand, if we remove all the visual elements, the written and spoken word would quickly become the only channel of communication left. For a significant proportion of people with visual impairments such as blindness, farsightedness, or age-related macular degeneration, this is the reality. In this article, I’ll share insights from my journey in UX, focusing on accessible writing and how it enhances the experience for users across web and mobile platforms.
### More Than Just Visuals
As a UX designer, I've come to realize that thoughtful UX writing, effective use of alt-text, and understanding how screen readers work across platforms are just as crucial for creating the best UX as visual design aspects. Ensuring a seamless experience for all users, regardless of ability, means creating content that works both visually and non-visually. Over the years, I’ve learned that accessible UX writing is not primarily about meeting legal requirements but about creating digital products that everyone can engage with on equal terms. It’s not just about checking a box – it’s about inclusion at every level.
### Microcopy: Small Words, Big Impact
Microcopy, although often overlooked, plays a pivotal role in accessibility. It includes those small, functional pieces of text – like button labels, tooltips, error messages – that guide users through an interface. But, first things first, let’s distinguish microcopy from other textual content. While some texts serve to market services within a digital product (marketing copy) or are intended to provide legal protection (legal copy), microcopy concentrates exclusively on the functional description
The key to writing inclusive microcopy is balancing clarity and brevity. While adding personality or cleverness to these small snippets is tempting, clarity must always come first. It must be clear, direct, and supportiveIs **everybody** going to be able to understand my message when they read or even just hear my words?
Another essential aspect of microcopy is anticipating user needs
This is just one of the many possible use cases where microcopy can make or break a person's experience, especially for those who are already facing challenges with accessibility. By offering clarity, guidance, and reassurance, you can help a person complete a task without unnecessary friction. Microcopy might be small in size, but it carries significant weight in shaping user experiences, especially for those with disabilities.
### Alt-Text: Descriptions Beyond the Visual
Alt-text is another crucial piece of accessible UX design, particularly for users who rely on screen readers. Whenever there’s a problem with your digital product, e.g., delayed loading times, alt-text will be the only alternative to describe the content of your visuals, which aren’t displayed, even for users who can see the design. For people who can’t see the visual UI elements, alt-texts become the only way to still have access to this information. 
So, if you take our error screen example from above, it wouldn’t be helpful if your message was simply represented by a funny image. If the image doesn’t load and there’s no alt-text applied for it, as a user, you wouldn’t even know that something went wrong. 
However, writing good alt-text involves more than just stating what’s shown within an image. It’s about translating the image's function in the screen's context.
Writing effective alt-text requires a clear understanding of the image’s role. Is it purely decorative, or does it provide essential information? Decorative images or images that don’t add meaningful information to the user experience should often be left without alt-text so that they don’t clutter the experience for screen reader users. For the images that do matter, the goal is to be specific enough to transfer the purpose but concise enough not to overwhelm the user.
### Screen Readers: Differences between Operating Systems
In order to make digital content accessible to visually impaired users, assistive technologies like external keyboards or screen readers play a major role. However, designing for screen readers on web platforms differs significantly from designing for mobile apps.
When designing for screen readers, the order in which content is read out loud becomes crucial. Screen readers follow a specific order, which can be manipulated to create a more intuitive experience. For example, if a user navigates a page with a complex layout, such as a live navigation, adjusting the reading order to prioritize key elements can dramatically improve the user’s experience. It might be helpful to tell the screen reader to ignore the linear so it will jump to the footer element of the screen, as this contains the information that’s essential for the next step in the routing instead of dealing with the interaction elements to center the map. It’s all about creating an intuitive, logical experience for the user.
Mobile users also interact differently with content due to the way VoiceOver (on iOS) and TalkBack (on Android) handle gestures. I had to learn that VoiceOver and TalkBack have distinct gestures and navigation patterns, and these differences must be accounted for when designing a seamless experience across platforms.
### Understanding iOS and Android: Platform-Specific Considerations
Though both iOS and Android strive to make their platforms accessible, the ecosystems of these operating systems differ in several ways. iOS tends to be more standardized, which is both a benefit and a limitation. Apple’s tight control over its devices ensures that users get a consistent experience across its ecosystem, whether they’re using an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook.
In contrast, Android’s product landscape is more fragmented, with many different manufacturers creating devices with varying screen sizes, operating systems, and accessibility features. Android’s flexibility is both a blessing and a curse for accessibility. It allows designers more creative freedom but can also create challenges when trying to maintain consistency across such a broad range of devices.
For example, Android might offer different navigation patterns based on the device’s manufacturer. Although we generally don’t need to create separate alt-texts or microcopy for iOS and Android, it’s essential to understand how each platform interprets and presents that information. At the end of the day, it’s about making sure the experience is as consistent and accessible as possible, regardless of the platform. You don’t want users to feel like they’re having a completely different experience just because they’ve switched devices.
Testing your designs on both systems and making adjustments to optimize for each platform is crucial for ensuring users don’t get stuck or lost as they navigate your product. You don’t always have to write separate alt-texts or microcopy for iOS and Android, but you do need to be aware of how each platform might interpret or present that information differently.
### Designing with Empathy
Incorporating accessibility into UX writing isn’t just a technical challenge and following guidelines; it’s a matter of empathy. It's also about understanding the experiences of all users, including those with disabilities, and making sure everyone can engage with digital products equally. Whether it’s making sure microcopy is clear and actionable, alt-text offers meaningful descriptions, or screen readers navigate content smoothly, the ultimate goal is to create an inclusive experience for all users.
Accessibility in UX writing means thinking beyond the visible. Every piece of text, every description, and every bit of content needs to be crafted with empathy, considering how it will be experienced by users with different kinds of abilities. Ultimately, you’re designing for people, and it’s your responsibility to ensure everyone can access and enjoy the digital products you create. By putting accessibility at the forefront of your design process, you can help bridge the gap between technology and users, ensuring that no one’s left behind.
For me, accessibility goes beyond fulfilling legal requirements or technical standards – it’s about creating equal opportunities for all users to engage with digital products. Whether you’re crafting microcopy, alt-text, or designing for screen readers, always try to put yourself in the shoes of those who use your product. That’s how you create truly inclusive digital experiences.
Stay tuned for more as we'll be deep diving into this topic soon, and sharing some best practices for creating an accessible user experience through writing. In the meantime, if you have any questions or want to discuss this topic further, feel free to reach out.

# 5 Years at COBE – Through the Eyes of Our Managing Director 
Katarina
Marketing Lead
Managing director of the Osijek office, MBA graduate (almost), and Manager of the year 2021, in the category of young managers – meet Ines.
Did you know that last year Ines celebrated her five years in COBE? With a degree in journalism and a background in PR, her path to the managing director role of a software company certainly wasn’t a usual one, but is it an inspiring one? Absolutely. Staying with the same company for 5+ years can bring many benefits along the way. To find out how it can affect your professional and personal growth too, keep reading – Ines has all the answers. 
Let’s rewind to 2016 for a second – what did it all look like when you first started working at COBE? What was your role, and what did your path to managing director look like?
  * I came to COBE as the 10th employee, and since I’m a journalist by profession, I started my career in the marketing and PR department – I say department, but it was just me. Nine out of ten people were developers at that time, which meant that lots of non-development tasks were, kind of, overlooked – not because nobody wanted to do them, there just weren’t enough people. Communication with the clients was one of them, and since I had a background in PR, I took on this responsibility. As the company gradually began to grow over the next few years, my role officially changed to Account manager, and with time, I became the Managing director’s right hand. When he decided to leave COBE, I faced the biggest challenge of my professional life – taking on the Managing director role. Even though it was a tough decision to make, I knew it made sense for COBE. Now, looking at the company’s results for the last two years, I’d say we made a pretty good decision at the time. 


Of course, it was the right decision! And before we get to the part where we explain why, let me just ask you, how does it feel to be at COBE for more than five years? 
  * The feeling is terrifying, in the best possible way. You know, I moved from Zagreb for this job, and in the beginning, I would have never thought I would stay in Osijek for more than two years. It was a completely new beginning for me – a new industry, a new job, a new place to live. It feels weird even talking about it, but in the end, this job fulfilled all my expectations (and beyond), and I’m incredibly grateful to have been here for the last five years. 


The fear of the unknown is completely normal at first, but getting out of your comfort zone has a big impact on your personal and professional growth, don’t you think? And not only yours**,** but the growth of the whole company. In your opinion, what’s the biggest progress COBE made in the last five years?
  * When I first joined COBE, the team was working on one, maybe two projects, and there were only ten of us. Today, we are a business of 50+ people, working on 7, 8 projects simultaneously. Our clients are important brands in the automotive, food, technology industry. I’m very proud that the projects we work on are getting bigger and more challenging every day. Having a supportive management and experienced team of designers in Munich also doesn’t harm **we recognize our strength in our togetherness.** ‍


Looking at our financial and business results over the years, there’s been a noticeable incline in the last two years. What’s the most significant difference you see in COBE since becoming managing director?
  * I became the managing director at a time the company didn’t have the best business results and was quite shaken by employee turnover rates. Looking back on that time, the biggest difference I notice is how much stronger we are today. The projects we work on are more complex, and the clients we work with are bigger and more recognized. More importantly, we have a solid team we can rely on, and that can rely on us – both financially and personally. I believe this became most evident in 2020, when the pandemic started, but even now. Over the last two years, our team grew by 100% – there were many promotions, certifications, and some of our employees even had career switches. Overall, we can be **really proud of the company we became** in such a short period of time. 


Working in the same company for a longer period surely influences your personal growth too, especially with a professional journey like yours. How did the managing director role impact your progress? 
  * I had no experience running a company at the time, and to be completely honest, I was scared to do it – I mean, I was taking on the responsibility for 20 people and their 20 families. Luckily, with time, that fear disappeared (and returned briefly when the pandemic began). Now, I can honestly say that I don’t feel it anymore – despite being responsible for 50+ families. I believe that calmness comes from surrounding myself with great clients, even greater projects, and a team that I can trust. And when that team is highly driven, you feel an obligation to grow and progress with them. 


I’m sure you’re familiar with the fact that four more people celebrate their fifth anniversary at COBE this year? Nine of them just marked their third year, and Mladen, our Finance manager, celebrates eight years at COBE 
  * To me, this is a sign that we’re doing something good, that people are happy here, and that they see their future in COBE. Honestly, I’d like for them to stay as long as possible – I mean, as long as it makes sense for them, but for us too. I believe people continue to choose COBE because they have the opportunity to discover what they’re good at, progress, and partake in the company’s decisions and growth. This is what motivated me to stay. I came to COBE as a communications expert, and after a while, I’ve been promoted to the role of Account manager, which I planned on doing for a while. Becoming the Managing director was never in my wildest dreams, but here I am. One of the first goals I set, then and there, was to enable others the same opportunities I had, and to progress in a similar way – **I believe that’s what draws people to stay at COBE.** They know that if they start their career as students, they’ll (most likely) get hired after graduation. If they come as junior designers, they’ll have the opportunity to become seniors, team leads, and even project leads one day. Plus, the usual benefits – Christmas, Easter, baby bonuses; birthday and wedding Giftcards; regular medical check-ups; meetings with a licensed psychotherapist; paid father’s leave; internal and external education; and much more. 


To keep things transparent – even with all the benefits and efforts of retaining every single employee, some of them still choose to leave. And you can’t take it personally. As you said in your acceptance speech for Manager of the Year
  * It’s true that people get bored easily, but this is where the advantages of working in an agency shine through. When you work in an agency, something new happens every day, the pace is more intense and the job doesn’t allow you to get bored so easily. If you’re a sucker for change, you have the option to switch between projects every couple of months. On the other hand, if you prefer working on one, long-term project, get to know your clients on a deeper level, and work with the same team every day, you can do that too – we have projects we’ve been working on for more than three years. It’s also important to mention that the projects we work on cover different industries so everyone can find something that interests them. But it’s not just that, working in an agency brings **many other possibilities**. One of them is being promoted to a much higher position over the years. Another one is switching career paths. One of our colleagues recently switched her role from a QA to a Business Analyst. Instead of searching for a new job somewhere else, she wanted to introduce this role to COBE. By proposing the idea and being honest with us, she showed us how, even though she changed career interests, she still chooses COBE as her employer. And we’re grateful for that. 


What do you see as the biggest benefit of staying with the same company?
  * Well, after being in the same company for as long as I have, you can without any doubt say that **you know the people you work with**. And just as much as you know their strengths and weaknesses, they also know yours. When you’re working with someone for a long time, you learn to approach problems together, you learn how to solve them, and in general, you have lots of common victories behind you. You learn together and you grow together. With certain people, it takes only a look and you both know what you’re thinking – this comes in handy in certain meetings. There’s also the benefit of watching your clients grow over the years and seeing your projects develop. 


What drives your progress after five years? What's your motivation?
  * What motivates me most is the responsibility I have towards my colleagues. I owe it to them to be the best version of myself and to enable them the career they want. Another reason, and this is a more selfish one, is that I want to prove to the world that everything can be done from a smaller environment, like Osijek. I often hear comments about the work pace in Osijek being much slower than somewhere else, and that’s so far from the truth. We do work hard, but the difference between Osijek and a bigger city is that work isn’t our whole life. We have a healthy balance between our private and business lives, while still working for some of the biggest brands in the industry. And I don’t see anything wrong with that. 


What’s next in your plans?
  * On a personal level, I still have a thesis to write, so my next step is to graduate. Learning doesn’t stop there though  I want to continue educating myself on becoming a better leader. As for the next steps in the company, I want to **bring our expertise to a whole new level** – hire more experts, work on even bigger projects, promote people, educate them, introduce new roles, and uplift our team leads. Our team doesn’t necessarily have to grow in numbers, but I want us to be the best we can be, in everything we do. Another important goal of mine is to keep **giving back to the community**. I think sometimes we all forget how blessed we are to work in the IT industry. That’s why I see helping others as one of our duties. I want our work to have an impact. Every year we make a smaller donation, but if we joined forces with other companies in Osijek Software City, I believe we could create something much bigger and really make a difference.


Your journey is inspiring to many, me first, therefore, what advice would you give to someone who has encountered an obstacle in their business life? Who wants to progress, but feels stuck? 
  * As a manager, I encountered situations where employees automatically dismissed an opportunity before even talking to someone about it – they immediately thought it wouldn't be possible. Don’t do this – don’t deny yourself an opportunity without giving it a real chance. Talk to your team lead or management and present them with your idea. A manager will rarely turn an idea or proactivity down. Especially if it’s beneficial for both you and the company. So talk to them and fight for it, because, at the end of the day, everyone’s responsible for their own future. And if you want to progress at work, think about the things that are going well for you, things which you are good at, and educate yourself on it. Become a specialist at what you do, and remember to always stay competitive. That’s my advice. 


What else is there to add? You heard all the benefits of staying with the same company for 5+ years. Or at least all benefits of staying with COBE. Ines’s story certainly is a special one, so if she inspired you to join our team and see what it’s all about, [check our open positions](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/about-us/career). 
It’s time for you to start your journey at COBE too. :)

# Inside COBE Camp: Creating a Company Culture Across International Offices
Katarina
Marketing Lead
Building a strong company culture isn’t an easy task, especially when your team is spread across different countries and different offices. Throw in a mix of languages, cultural nuances, and varying communication styles – it can get pretty easy for teams to start feeling disconnected, without even realizing it. That’s why it’s so important to create shared experiences that bring your team together, no matter where they’re working from.
One way we achieve that is through something we call COBE Camp – an internal event that’s become a cornerstone of how we connect, share knowledge, and grow together as a team. 
Keep reading to find out what COBE Camp is all about, why we started it, and how it’s helped us build a culture rooted in learning, knowledge-sharing, and international teamwork. Maybe it can work for you, too. 
### How it all started 
Let’s kick things off with the name itself; the “COBE” part is pretty obvious, but why camp? Okay, maybe that part is obvious as well, because it’s exactly what it sounds like. You know how, when you’re out camping, you’re gathered around a fire with a few people, sharing stories, maybe preparing some good food? That’s the exact vibe we were going for with COBE Camp. Only, instead of a fire, we gather around a TV in our office, share updates, swap ideas, enjoy some food and drinks, and just hang out as a team. It’s our way of stepping out of the day-to-day and reconnecting with each other.
We kicked off the first COBE Camp back in 2014, when there were just around 15 of us. Felix, one of our CEOs, had the idea to host a monthly get-together where we could share what we were working on, talk about what was happening in both offices, and learn something new from each other. To be honest, in those early days, it was mostly Felix leading the sessions, sharing his interests, playing TED talks he found relevant, and setting the tone for what would become a long-standing tradition. 
Today, the events look a tad bit different. While the core idea hasn’t changed much over the years, the structure, content, and quality of each session definitely has. And that’s only natural; our team has grown from 15 to nearly 90 people. That’s 90 different opinions and interests, which makes every Camp session fun and different.
### How it works today
These days, COBE Camp has definitely leveled up. Okay, not in a flashy, over-the-top kind of way, but enough that it’s become a real highlight on our internal calendar.
Being a hybrid and remote-friendly company, coming to the office is always optional. But somehow, when it’s COBE Camp day, the office is always packed. Coincidence? Maybe. Whatever the reason, it’s always nice to see the office bustling with people.
Now, talking about the logistics, a typical Camp day includes four presentations: two local ones held in each office (in the team’s native language) and two company-wide sessions in English, streamed via Google Meet. Sometimes, a presentation runs long, so it's not always four, but typically, we aim to wrap things up within two hours. The topics range from project updates and team wins to passion projects, hobbies, or fun side initiatives. Every now and then, we invite external speakers to bring fresh perspectives or dive into topics we don’t normally cover. That’s a good way to break the routine. 
To keep things fresh, we also like to mix in interactive elements – think quizzes, Q&As, or little challenges, so that it’s not just a sit-and-listen kind of thing. And keep in mind; with nearly 90 people across the company, it’s important to make everyone feel included, whether they’re tuning in remotely or joining in person. So make sure the setup works just as well for those joining from afar.
Oh, and one more thing – even though we started with it being a monthly event, shifting to a quarterly schedule ended up being a much better fit. It gives our organization team more time to plan meaningful sessions and fun after-parties while leaving just enough space between events for people to actually miss
### What makes it special?
Aside from the obvious part of having something regular and reliable on the calendar (turns out most people do
Sure, we already collab on projects and hop on weekly calls with coworkers from other offices, but COBE Camp creates space for something different. It’s a chance to slow down, connect in a more informal way, and get a glimpse into the interests and passions behind the names or roles.
I still remember one of my first Camp sessions, when a coworker (and now friend) showed some impressive Hungarian folk dancing moves. As an introvert myself, I could never do that, but it was such a cool moment to witness. 
Over the years, we’ve seen people present side hustles, share personal travel stories, and showcase everything from photography to philosophy.
And then there’s the after-parties; we’ve had casino nights, cocktail parties, pub quizzes, wine tastings, movie marathons… you name it. And we’re not stopping yet. 
### Why you should do it too
After 11 years, it’s safe to say COBE Camp has become one of our core traditions. And traditions matter. They create a shared sense of belonging, something for people to look forward to, and something they can feel proud to be part of.
It’s easy to say “we value collaboration” or “we support continuous learning”, but it’s through traditions that these values actually come to life. For example, a knowledge-sharing event can turn curiosity into a habit, and a recurring quiz night (or cocktail party) reinforces playfulness and team spirit. But, of course, you can keep it as simple as a birthday shoutout system that shows care and recognition. 
But back to COBE Camp – it has shaped our company culture in more ways than we expected. So if you're looking to build stronger internal, cross-office connections, you might consider trying this format. Here are a few tips:
  1. Pick a structure and stick to a rhythm: 
  2. Mix learning with fun:
  3. Rotate speakers and themes to keep it fresh:
  4. Make it hybrid/remote friendly:
  5. Most importantly, make it yours:yours


Because in the end, it’s about creating something that reflects your team, your values, and your ✨vibe✨. If you’re thinking about starting something similar, keep it simple, listen to your team, and put your own spin on it. And if you got any questions on how or where to start, just reach out.

# 10 Biggest Leadership Lessons We’ve Learned as CEOs During the Last Decade
Norina
Marketing Manager
The worst-case scenario when founding a company? A bank debt and a shattered dream. But giving up? Never!
Turning the idea of your own agency into reality is not always easy. It involves a great deal of passion, hours and hours of work and stamina. But when blood, sweat and tears pay off, the joy is all the bigger. Ten years ago, four young designers had this dream. Today, their dream is reality, and if you ask them: “Would you do it again?” Their answer is: “Anytime!
If you follow our 
Lesson No. 1: Trust in Yourself and Others
Let's be honest: starting your own agency requires a lot from you. Eight hours of work a day is not nearly enough, especially in the beginning. Maybe you're lucky enough to have co-founders that can take some pressure off. But in order for everyone to reach their full potential, you need to let them have their freedom and trust that they can do it without you – even in a crisis. You probably like to do things a certain way, but dividing responsibility – you'll get more perspectives on certain topics.
#### Lesson No. 2: Hang in There!
Remember that it can't always be uphill. Even when times seem tough and hopeless, patience and stamina pay off – making decisions head over heels is never a good idea. The important thing is to be clear: Where do I want to go with this? What other options do I have? What perspectives do I need to include for my own decision?
#### Lesson No. 3: Leave Your Ego at Home
I know this works differently for many companies, but hear me out: it doesn't have to be crystal clear who the boss is as soon as you enter the room. Being feared is not the same as being respected. Trying to be in control of everything is not only incredibly exhausting, but it’s also completely pointless – especially when you reach a certain size.
#### Lesson No. 4: Hire the Right People
The plain truth is, you can't be a professional and exceed in every business area. Why would you even want to do that? The goal is to hire people that are experts in their field, that do certain things better than you, and in the end, to succeed together. To achieve that, you have to be aware of your weaknesses and your strengths. Combining strengths and having the same goals in mind when working together has proven to work the best for us. You should try it out!
The leadership team is constantly working on team building.
#### Lesson No. 5: Culture Is King
Agency business is people business. Our assets are the people we have – a team only works if everyone respects and trusts each other. You have to give everyone the chance to grow, try different things out, and have fun while working together. At the end of the day, the time we spend at work and with our colleagues is a lifetime. You know that COBE stands for Creators of beautiful experiences, right? Even though you might think this only refers to creating beautiful products, it actually refers to developing a beautiful company culture too.
#### Lesson No. 6: Something Is Off? Act Fast!
When you, as a leader, sense that something is changing, something off is happening, you have to pull the trigger. Figuratively, of course. Find the root of the problem as soon as you can and deal with it. That gives you time to fix a situation, rather than have someone leave due to something that you could've worked on.
#### Lesson No. 7: Work With Tensions
We've established a culture where employees feel comfortable and where no one has to hold back on their opinion or disagreement. For our team in Munich, Holacracy is the ideal, “go-to” organizational model for that. On one hand, you give away some of your “power”, while on the other, you give impact to every single employee. In Holocracy, each employee can address any tensions they have at all times.
#### Lesson No. 8: Get a Mentor
Involve a mentor, an advisor, or however you want to call it, as early as possible. Having a person on the outside to assist you, give you advice, and analyze you and your business is worth its weight in gold. Overestimating yourself and thinking you'll figure everything out somehow is not the right strategy. Mentors have the experience that you just can't have at the beginning. A mentor can help you, as a founder, or manager to grow, broaden your horizons, and to think about new ideas.
#### Lesson No. 9: You Want to Be a Leader? Then Lead!
It's great to see yourself as part of the team. There’s nothing wrong with communicating at eye level. But as a founder you have set a goal in mind, and you have to guide people accordingly, so that they find their way too. Sometimes, you have to accept not being in the middle of it, but leading from the outside.
#### Lesson No. 10: Find the Right Leaders for the Right Role
When one thing gets too big: Give up control. With the right person at the lead, any project takes off. In the case of COBE Osijek, that person was Ines. Different locations require different leaders who understand not only the culture, but also the people, and get the best potential out of everything.
""Giving Ines the power to change things, to have impact, was one of the best moves we made in our history."" - Felix
### ""Would I do it again? Yes, I would do it again!""
Sure, it's sometimes hard to always see the positive when it is difficult. But the path to the goal is also important. Looking back at the last 10 years, our two founders are grateful: “The experiences, the projects, and people we met were worth fighting for and not giving up. We're here to have beautiful experiences together and to create beautiful experiences for others. The experiences we gathered and the people we met are priceless. We're proud of all we have established and the team we built.”
That’s it! We hope our CEOs inspired your leadership journey, and if you want to dig even deeper on the topic, make sure to reach out.

# Bluetooth in Mobile App Development: Essential Overview
Matija
Mobile Developer
Bluetooth technology is all around us, effortlessly connecting the devices we rely on daily. From listening to music on your wireless headphones to making calls on your car's speaker, Bluetooth ensures reliable performance. And, let's be honest — who even goes for a run without a fitness tracker nowadays? 
It has become such a seamless part of our lives that we barely even think about it — Bluetooth pairs all sorts of IoT devices, from washing machines and lights to home audio systems. It's even used in medical devices like glucose monitors to send data directly to your phone. Bluetooth also helps with navigation in big places like airports or shopping malls, offering location-based services to point out nearby stores or helpful information. 
Considering its wide use and popularity, have you ever wondered how Bluetooth technology actually works and how IoT devices communicate with each other? Whether you're already familiar with Bluetooth development or not, I'm here to share an essential overview with you.
## Basics First
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that runs on radio waves, specifically in the 2.4 GHz frequency range and is also used by Wi-Fi and cordless phones. The connections happen through something called a piconet
Bluetooth was first introduced mainly for wireless headsets and simple file transfers. As technology improved, Bluetooth started offering better data rates and extended range. The future looks even more promising, with a lot of room for improvements down the road.
### Bluetooth Classic vs. Bluetooth LE
Did you know that your headphones and fitness tracker use different types of Bluetooth depending on how they manage data and power?
The first type is called Bluetooth ClassicBluetooth Low Energy (LE)
With the arrival of Bluetooth 5.0, we've seen some significant improvements – the range has been expanded to 240 meters, and data transfer speeds are noticeably faster. Bluetooth 5.0 has also improved the functionality of Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) for IoT devices, giving it a competitive advantage over Bluetooth Classic.
### Benefits of Bluetooth Technology
The great thing about it is its wide compatibility across different devices and platforms, which makes it a win-win for everyone. 
#### 1. For Users
One of the biggest perks of Bluetooth for end users is its low power usage
Another perk lies in its flexibilityconvenience‍
#### 2. For Businesses 
Incorporating Bluetooth technology into your products can benefit your business, too. One of the biggest perks is boosting efficiencysaving on costs
All these benefits ultimately add up to improved customer experience. When your users have a seamless experience, they’re more likely to stick around, and over time, that loyalty just starts to grow naturally.
## Developing Apps With Bluetooth Technology
### Choosing The Right Framework
Choosing the right platform early in the development process is crucial, as it establishes the foundation for your app's functionality and user experience.
If an app heavily relies on Bluetooth features, I highly recommend going with native development
When it comes to Android
Unlike Android, iOS
### The Communication Process
For the devices to connect with Bluetooth technology, they must first establish a communication channel. Let's break it down into three basic steps:
  1. Discovery
  2. Pairing
  3. Data transfer


To start, devices need to be discoverable so they can find each other – that's the part when you turn on Bluetooth on your phone. Once discovered, the devices are paired, and they'll establish a secure connection. After successful pairing, they can finally exchange data with each other.
As mentioned previously, Bluetooth LE is commonly used for communication nowadays. It utilizes different profilescharacteristics
What also makes Bluetooth technology so convenient is that you can connect to a variety of devices, and it doesn't have to be limited to just one. It allows apps to connect multiple devices simultaneously, creating personalized and functional experiences. As a result, users can easily control and monitor various devices right from their smartphones.
### Testing The Bluetooth Apps
Just like the development process, [testing Bluetooth apps](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/how-to-start-testing-bluetooth-apps-a-guide-for-beginners) can also be pretty tricky due to their complexity. So, before you even start, it's important you understand the purpose, functionality, and data behavior of the Bluetooth device you'll be working with. 
Before anything else, you have to ensure proper pairing between devices and monitor how the app handles permissions and multiple connections. Next, test how distance affects connection quality, as users may not always be near the device. Another essential step is evaluating the firmware's performance, including how updates are handled and potential issues. Finally, you'll have to test the app's communication between the app and the Bluetooth device. 
## What’s Next for Bluetooth?
Bluetooth technology has come a long way, evolving with innovations like Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) and the enhancements of Bluetooth 5.0. These upgrades have made data exchanges much more efficient, extending the operational range to around 200 meters and allowing for larger data transfers. Looking ahead, Bluetooth holds great promise in fields such as healthcare, IoT, and smart city solutions.
If you want to take a closer look into our development process involving IoT devices and Bluetooth technology, stay tuned for our upcoming case study.

# Choosing Your Next Headless CMS? Keep an Eye on Directus 9. 
Ivan
Frontend Development Lead
For the past year, I have been testing a few headless CMS’s, like Strapi, Contentful, and GraphCMS, in order to find the ""right"" one. Even headless WordPress made the list, but the one that stood out to me, in the end, was Directus 9 – so let’s give it the attention it deserves.
Directus is an open-source data platform
wraps any SQL database with a real-time GraphQL+REST API and an intuitive app for non-technical users. ‍
### History
When you first install Directus 9 and start using it, you might get a feeling it’s a very mature product, even though you have just heard of it. That’s because Directus actually has a relatively long and interesting history. And that’s why I'm calling it Directus 9, and not just Directus. Directus 8 and all the versions before it, were entirely different applications. Although they all do the same thing, they were written in PHP, like the Zend framework
Since the Zend framework became outdated, and they wanted to test it out in Node as well, the Directus team decided to transport it to the Laravel framework. The Node version turned out to be pretty fast to build, and it showed great promise — mostly because the API responses were 10 times faster than the PHP version. To go even further in time, Directus first appeared as a Flash-based asset and database GUI under the working title ""dir"" in 2006. Versions after that were written in PHP, and then it was rewritten again in backbone.js for UI, while PHP handled the server side. And now we have Directus 9 with Node.js in the backend and Vue.js for the CMS UI. As far as I know, they are still developing the community-driven Laravel-PHP version, but the Node version is the official version of the platform.
### Features
#### Databases
As stated before, Directus 9 communicates with SQL databases to serve data to API endpoints. That way, you can consume that data with React, Next.js, Vue, or even mobile applications. Currently, the supported databases are PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, OracleDB, MariaDB, AWS Aurora, and many more.
#### Collections
One great thing about Directus 9, and the way it handles your databases, is that when you create a new Collection - which is just a fancy word for a data type (like posts, movies, books) - you are actually creating a new table in your database with all the corresponding columns that that data type consists of. 
This creation process is very easy to understand due to its great UI. Even something like creating many-to-many
#### Roles and permissions
Directus 9 features a pretty granular role and permission system which allows you to easily set the permissions for any of the unlimited number of roles you may have in your app.
#### ‍ Extensibility
#### Listening to the community
Directus 9 just came out with a new update, but it continues adding new major features and rewoking systems. 
For example - when I started using Directus 9, just a little over 7 months ago, I didn't really like the way it handled content translation. It was kind of clunky, and from what I gather I wasn't the only one that didn't like it. But, a few weeks ago I stumbled upon this on my Twitter feed.
The translations inside Directus 9 are much more streamlined and much easier to work with now. 
#### Design
I don't have much to say about this one, except that I'm a sucker for [great design](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services), and switching from Strapi to Directus is a breath of fresh air. I love the design of the CMS UI and even the Directus 9 website looks good. 
#### And much, much more...
Of course, Directus 9 has more features, which it shares with the competition: revision history, content translation, data validation, dynamic thumbnails, image editor, full white-labeling, REST API, GraphQL API, custom event hooks, and many more. 
### Pricing
Basically, you have two options:
  1. to host it yourself for free 
  2. to buy a hosted version that comes with automatic updates, backups, and application monitoring


The self-hosted (free) version is not nerfed in any way. It's the same as the hosted (paid) one - you just have to take care of the infrastructure yourself.
### Why choose Directus 9? 
Directus 9 feels fresh and mature at the same time, and you can’t really say that about many products. Most CMSs seem pretty similar and have the same (or similar) features, but Directus 9 just kind of stuck with me.
If you don’t believe me, just test it out yourself. You should never trust a random guy on the Internet. 😏
If you want to learn even more and see Directus 9 in action, make sure to check the

# Building Long-Term Client Relationships in a Rapidly Changing Industry
Goran
Head of Development
Trends are evolving faster than ever – not just in IT but across every industry. With new tools, techniques, and technologies on the rise, it can be hard to keep up. On top of that, competition is tougher than ever, and standing out requires constant development and innovation. No pressure, right?
That’s why long-term relationships with clients are key to growth and success. Everything great takes time, and building a solid partnership is hard work, but it’s one of the best ways to help a business grow in the long run. Let’s take a look at why long-term client relationships matter, what are some of the challenges you might encounter along the way, and some tips that can help you along the way.
### Why long-term client relationships matter
When running a business, you have to factor in elements such as market trends, competition, and economic crises. Given these are out of your control, you can look at long-term client relationships as foundations that provide stability, consistency, and opportunities
Some of these opportunities can be, for example, new clients coming through referrals from existing ones. This means existing clients can help you enter new industries much faster than through the usual channels. Upselling gets easier, too. Negotiations with new clients can sometimes take up to six months, but for clients with ongoing projects, the process can be much quicker and smoother. Plus, since there’s no competitive pitch to stress over, it's usually more cost-effective.
Another perk of long-term relationships is that you already know your clients – their budget, working style, and communication preferences. Over time, expectations become clear on both sides, which makes maintaining the relationship much easier than building one from scratch.
### Building long-term client relationships
Keep in mind, building a long-term relationship doesn’t happen overnight. A great partnership is built through consistency, reliability, open communication, and most of all, time. It’s a complex calculation, but I have some tips that can help you along the way.
#### 1. Set clear expectations from the start
Expectations can be affected by lots of different factors, such as time constraints, budget, and other limitations. If they're not managed properly, misunderstandings can lead to frustration on both sides.
#### 2. Remember the importance of communication
When communication breaks down, it can lead to a project being canceled, postponed or passed over by another company. Clear and consistent communication is crucial to keep the project moving forward.
#### 3. Keep communication transparent
Don’t be mysterious. The best way to make clients feel valued and secure is through transparency. Agile methodology plays a significant role here as clients receive regular reports on hours spent, tasks completed, and reviews. They’re not just waiting for a monthly update but have direct access to tools like Confluence, JIRA, GitHub, and Figma, so they’re always in the loop.
#### 4. Align with clients’ preferences
On the other hand, sometimes it’s okay to be mysterious and work your magic. Some clients want to be more involved, while others trust us from the start to solve their problem and don’t need to know all the details of the process. In these cases, they only receive periodic reviews. Either way, regular check-ins and feedback loops help maintain clarity and alignment.
#### 5. Anticipate problems
Avoiding conflict starts with active listening. Listening to the client and ensuring they feel heard and understood is essential. The goal isn’t just to fix problems as they come up but to anticipate and prevent them before they escalate. Of course, every client is different; some are eager to tackle issues head-on, while others might need more guidance. Their personality, level of involvement, and understanding of the problem all play a role in how smoothly the process unfolds. Remember, clients are still people – it’s like resolving an issue in any other relationship.
#### 6. Meet in the middle
Every project has its bumps, and sometimes both sides need to adapt. The key is in understanding each other’s needs and working together to find the best possible solution.
#### 7. Proactivity goes a long way
It’s a cliche, but think outside of the box. Clients want to see that we’re not just problem-solvers but forward-thinkers. By aligning our solutions with their business goals and focusing on long-term success, you create a win-win scenario for everyone involved.
#### 8. Personalization
Whatever your business is, you’re likely working on solutions tailored to your clients’ specific problems. That means you take the time to thoroughly understand their cases and craft custom-made solutions to ensure the best possible results. It’s another cliche, but sticking out in a crowd does bring real benefits.
#### 9. Make it fun
While professionalism is crucial, we also believe collaboration should be fun. That’s why we create opportunities for connection beyond the usual meetings – whether it’s Christmas parties, workshops, or casual dinners. These moments help build trust, strengthen partnerships, and make collaboration more rewarding for everyone.
For example, a few years back we celebrated our 5th work anniversary with [j.Wagner GmbH](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/projects/wagner-spraymanager), a client we’ve been working with on multiple projects throughout the years. To say thank you, we prepared a presentation for the client, alongside a matching 5-year anniversary jersey – something our own employees get for their 5-year work anniversary at COBE. While it's important to mark project milestones, celebrating partnerships should be equally important. Bringing people together beyond merely the business side of it is a fantastic way to mark the successes of your collaboration.
#### Tackling challenges
Like with video games, or really anything in life, challenges along the way are unavoidable. Probably one of the biggest challenges you’ll likely encounter in long-term client relationships is managing resources. When a project scales down, team members might need to switch to other projects. It’s on you to handle these transitions smoothly so that the client doesn’t notice any disruption in workflow or a drop in quality. Since these transitions can take months, careful planning is essential.
Client expectations have also grown significantly over the past few years. While the demand for effort and quality has increased, budgets have remained tight. Factors like competitive pricing and offshoring have all contributed to this shift. With more options available, clients are carefully weighing their choices, making it even more important to build strong, lasting relationships.
And working in a changing industry, it’s necessary to keep up with trends and technology to remain competitive. Today, this means [embracing AI and automation](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/how-ai-and-automation-go-hand-in-hand-with-designops) as a tool that can give you an edge, allowing your teams to focus on high-value work that leads to meaningful final products for your clients.
#### Going forward
Everything in this article is drawn from my own experience in the industry, and if there’s one key takeaway I can leave you with, it’s the importance of developing strong communication skills. We all want to be heard, and your clients especially. Take your time, keep up with trends and technology, and approach your client relationships honestly – all that will put you on the right path.
The industry is changing all the time, and it’s important to be ready for whatever may come your way. But if you’ve worked hard on building and maintaining strong relationships with your clients, then you’ll likely be ready to withstand anything coming your way.

# Exploring the Pros and Cons of Holacracy
Felix
Co-Founder & Managing Director
For a couple of years now, traditional hierarchical structures have faced criticism for their lack of adaptability and slow decision-making processes. Holacracy, a management philosophy that distributes authority and decision-making throughout an organization, has gained attention as a potential solution. By granting individuals autonomy and promoting self-organization, Holacracy aims to foster innovation, improve employee engagement, and drive organizational growth.
We introduced Holacracy at COBE approximately five years ago. This meant ditching a pyramid organizational structure where all decisions came from the top and welcoming a decentralized, more flexible one. In a holacratic structure, teams (we also call them circles) are formed around specific projects or tasks, working towards a common goal. Within those circles, each team member takes up a certain role and has the autonomy to make decisions within their area of responsibility. 
### How Holacracy at COBE Works
  * **Roles and Circles:** Holacracy replaces traditional job titles and hierarchies with flexible, changing roles. Each role is assigned according to the person’s skillset and, of course, the current demands of the company. It’s important to note that roles follow the organization’s purpose and can cover various functions and tasks. Team members can even be nested within broader circles that represent semi-autonomous teams or departments.


  * **Governance Process:** Holacracy uses a defined governance process to create and modify roles, accountabilities, and policies within the organization. This process involves regular governance meetings where participants can propose changes and modifications to their team members. After evaluating those proposals together, we make decisions based on how they affect the organization’s purpose. 


  * **Tactical Meetings:** Tactical meetings, also known as check-ins, are held to address any day-to-day operational issues and to ensure that work is progressing smoothly. All role holders use these meetings to update others on their progress, discuss challenges and seek help, or input, from other team members. All in all, tacticals help the team to synchronize efforts and facilitate coordination. 


  * **Role Assignments and Accountabilities:** Each role in the Holacracy circle has clear accountabilities and expectations associated with it. These accountabilities define the work and responsibilities of each role. Every role assignment is made based on the skills, interests, and capacity of an individual. But, one individual can be assigned multiple roles, simultaneously. This means that a UX/UI designer at COBE can also be a photographer if they are skilled in this area. This allows the organization, as well as the employees, to leverage their full potential – even besides their core skillset. 


  * **Decision-Making:** Holacracy emphasizes a distributed decision-making process. This means that we share authority across roles, rather than concentrate it in a traditional management hierarchy. The role holder that’s closest to the specific issue makes the decisions. The decision-making process is often accompanied by a defined set of rules and procedures, ensuring transparency and fairness at all times.


  * **Rapid Iteration and Adaptation:** Holacracy encourages an iterative approach to organizational development. It promotes experimentation, learning, and continuous improvement. Regular meetings and processes provide opportunities for individuals and teams to propose changes, test new ideas, and make adjustments as needed to improve performance and effectiveness.


Over the years, Holacracy has proven to be very beneficial to COBE. However, like any approach, it has its advantages and disadvantages. So let’s delve into the pros and cons to provide a comprehensive understanding of Holacracy’s benefits and potential challenges.
### Pros
  1. Enhanced Autonomy and Empowerment


Holacracy distributes authority and decision-making, granting team members more autonomy in their roles. This empowerment can lead to increased job satisfaction and engagement, as individuals feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for their work. By eliminating bureaucratic hurdles, Holacracy encourages team members to take initiative, make decisions, and be innovative. This has shown to work extremely well at COBE. In our internal surveys, our team has shared multiple times that they feel like, this way, they’re making an even bigger impact on the organization.
  1. Improved Agility and Adaptability


Traditional hierarchical structures can be slow to respond to changes in the market or internal needs. Holacracy’s dynamic nature enables organizations to adapt more rapidly. By decentralizing decision-making, it facilitates faster response times and encourages experimenting. We’ve been practicing Holacracy for over five years now, and one of the important things we learned along the way is to react extremely quickly to changes. Take this example, for instance: if we’re asked to provide an extensive case study about AI, we’ll introduce the role of e.g. “AI Expert” into one of our circles, search for a person who’s already familiar with the topic and wants to learn even more about it and assign it to them. What’s important to note here is that introducing a new role is never a top-down decision. We create them on an “expert level” and they don’t have to get clearance from a higher level. Sometimes, this leads to creating short-term roles, but nevertheless, an iterative approach like this leads to the organization always adapting to new circumstances promptly
  1. Clarity and Accountability


Holacracy introduces a clear set of rules and processes for defining roles and responsibilities. This clarity helps avoid ambiguity and confusion within an organization, ensuring that everyone understands their individual roles and contributions. At COBE, we have fixed role definitions, but we’re pretty flexible about who fills them. Once we define the role, we search for the best fit for it. For example, if it’s a designer who has always had a thing for copywriting, we know who to assign the role of the copywriter to. The important thing to note here is that the designer doesn’t have to give up their design role for their role in the circle. Most people at COBE have more than one role. 
Additionally, Holacracy promotes transparency
  1. Increased Innovation and Collaboration


By breaking down silos and fostering cross-functional collaboration, Holacracy facilitates the exchange of ideas and knowledge across teams and departments. With increased autonomy and a focus on self-organization, our team is encouraged to contribute their unique perspectives and expertise at all times. This enables us to tap into the collective intelligence of our workforce, which leads to innovative and creative solutions. Holacracy has made us much more solution-oriented in general; Everyone inside the circle knows their role, they own it, and they understand that they’re in charge of finding solutions for structural problems. Most importantly, Holacracy enables us to optimize our strong COBE potential
Now, let’s examine the cons.
### Cons
  1. Potential Role Ambiguity


In Holacracy, traditional job titles and hierarchical reporting structures are replaced by roles and circles. While this provides flexibility, it can also lead to confusion and role ambiguity. If your team doesn’t understand their responsibilities, it could easily result in work overlaps. To overcome this challenge (or to prevent it from occurring), it’s important to be transparent about the role inquiries and to provide adequate training if necessary. 
  1. Lack of Centralized Decision-Making


Having decentralized decision-making has its pros, but sometimes it can prolong the process of coming to a conclusion. Some decisions simply require input from other roles or circles – without a centralized authority, this can lead to delays or blockers. Once again, to avoid this, it’s important to communicate effectively. One way to do this is to introduce a meeting with leaders from different circles into your structure. Then, every once in a while, they can align with each other efficiently. 
  1. A Possible Cultural Shift


Implementing Holacracy often faces resistance, skepticism, or lack of understanding from those who are used to a more traditional hierarchical structure. This is why it’s important to invest in comprehensive change management strategies
  1. Potential for Increased Workload


Since Holacracy adds responsibility, there’s a possibility it could lead to increased workload or stress. This is why it’s important that everyone has the necessary support, resources, and ability to be transparent about their feelings and needs. On the one hand, we’ve had colleagues that took on too many roles at once, and on the other, ones that didn’t want to fill another role in addition to their core skills. To avoid this, it’s important that the circle leads align on a regular basis and make sure that every team member’s workload allows for a maximum impact. Fostering a culture of authenticity, openness, and encouraging honest discussions about one’s workload is an essential part of managing this issue. 
### Final thoughts
Holacracy presents a compelling alternative to traditional hierarchical structures, offering increased autonomy, adaptability, and innovation potential. On the other hand, implementing Holacracy requires careful consideration of its potential weaknesses, such as role ambiguity, cultural shifts, and workload concerns. If you address these challenges effectively, your company can utilize the benefits of holacracy while minimizing any potential downsides. 
For us, it’s an operating system that allows just the right amount of flexibility and adaptability. We realized that following Holocracy by the playbook can lead to a certain overhead of meetings and discussions, which is why we adjusted it to fit our organization’s characteristics and needs. In a way, we have built our very own version of Holacracy, and I’m sure that today, nobody at COBE, could imagine switching back to the traditional pyramid structure anymore.

# How to Build Modern Layouts With CSS Grid
Marina
Frontend Developer
You want to make compound yet modern layout designs? Great, let me show you how to achieve that easily using just the CSS grid. So get comfortable, grab some sweets and let’s start - many examples await. :)
### Introduction
Unlike flexbox, the CSS grid is a two-dimensionallinesrowscolumnscontaineritemscell
So far, these are the keywords you need to know. But let’s jump to the basic concepts to learn even more.
### Basic concepts
First things first, you want to create a simple UI by placing six simple divs (itemscontainer
The next step is to define the rows and columns. To do that, you need to set the grid-template-columnsgrid-template-rowsgrid-template grid-gapgrid-row-gap 
##### const Container = styled.div` display: grid; grid-template-rows: 100px 150px; grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 100px; // shorter version // grid-template: 100px 150px / 100px 200px 100px; grid-gap: 8px; ` 
And voila
Now, try to resize your screen. You can notice that with the viewport change, those cells stay at the same size. Define the second column to be auto instead of value in pixels, and resize your screen once again. The first and third columns will stay the same and the second one is now flexible.
But, what if you want to make your grid even more responsive? Instead of using current column values, replace them with a new unit called a fraction
Let’s say we have 12 columns. Twelve times writing 1frrepeat
##### grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr) 
### Simple Web page layout
Let’s imagine a simple web page layout design with a header on the top, a menu sidebar, some content, and of course a footer at the bottom of the page. To achieve this, we’ll use the second example, with just a few modifications. 
Before we start managing our layout, you need to get to know two new properties, grid-columngrid-row
For example, grid-column: 1/3; grid-column: 1/span 2;
You could also start counting lines from right to left - then it has a negative value. So, if you want your row to start from the first line and to stop at the very end, you can write: grid-column: 1/-1;
With this knowledge, you can make a simple layout for a web page. Just target every item and define the grid-column and grid-row properties for each.
##### // header &:nth-child(1) { grid-column: 1 / -1; grid-row: 1 / 2; } // side menu &:nth-child(2) { grid-column: 1 / 2; grid-row: 1 / 3; } // content &:nth-child(3) { grid-column: 2 / -1; grid-row: 2 / 3; } // footer &:nth-child(4) { grid-column: 1 / -1; grid-row: 3 / 4; }
It will look something like this:
### Grid template areas
If the previous example was a bit messy due to counting lines, maybe you’ll find this one more helpful. There’s no counting at all and it’s pretty visual. :D 
Instead of writing the grid-columngrid-rowgrid-areahmf 
##### const Box = styled.div<{ color:="""" string="""" }="""">` &:nth-child(1) { grid-area: h; } &:nth-child(2) { grid-area: m; } &:nth-child(3) { grid-area: c; } &:nth-child(4) { grid-area: f; } `
And one last thing to set: in the parent element define the property grid-template-areas
##### grid-template-areas: 'm m h h h h' 'm m c c c c' 'm m f f f .'
And the result is right here. OK, maybe this design is not the best looking, but you get the point.
### Minmax function
So far, you’ve learned that using fractions will make the grid responsive and cells will expand as long as you increase the resolution on our screen, but also shrink as long as you decrease it. (The first grid image has a width of 300px and the second one 600px.)
##### grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
But, what if you don’t want to expand the cells that much? What if you just want to have a minimum and maximum width of the column?
For that purpose, you can use the minmax
Notice that the third row is not looking the same as the previous two and that’s because we defined only two rows, while every other will have the size of its content. So, to fix that, just replace grid-template-rowsgrid-auto-rows
##### grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr)); grid-auto-rows: 100px;
### Fit vs Fill
Auto-fitauto-fill
You are probably having trouble finding the difference between these two. Well, currently there’s none. But, if you change the viewport and turn on the grid overlays, you will see it.
The Auto-fitAuto-fill
### Gallery
Now, let's use the knowledge from the previous examples and build a cool and responsive gallery. This is your last task.
First, create an array of objects where each object will have an image and a size property. Map through them and display the images. Set the grid with rows and columns - the fourth example might help with this
Let’s say you want horizontal, vertical, normal, and big images. At this point, they’re all a normal size. A horizontal image will take 2 columns and 1 row, a vertical 1 column and 2 rows, a big one 2 rows and 2 columns, and the normal 1 row and 1 column.
To do that, you just need to define the grid-columngrid-rowgrid-column: span 2; grid-row: span 2;
Use the same logic for defining others.
##### const Box = styled.img<{ name:="""" string="""" }="""">` width: 100%; height: 100%; ${(props) => props.name === 'big' && css` grid-column: span 2; grid-row: span 2; `}; ${(props) => props.name === 'horizontal' && css` grid-column: span 2; grid-row: span 1; `}; ${(props) => props.name === 'vertical' && css` grid-column: span 1; grid-row: span 2; `}; ` const Gallery = () => { return ( 
Now it looks like a nice gallery. But what about all those empty spaces? Can normal size pictures be placed here? Of course they can!
We just have to define one more property called grid-auto-flowrowdense 
##### const Container = styled.div` display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr)); grid-auto-rows: 100px; grid-gap: 8px; grid-auto-flow: dense; `
And now it looks great, even on mobile devices!
### To conclude
I hope I’ve helped you learn some basics about the CSS grid and maybe even more. 
Before I forget, did you know you can use a grid with the flexbox? Cool, right? Now jump into more practicing and experimenting. I wish you luck. :)

# Getting Started With Clean Architecture for Android [Part 2]
David
Mobile Developer
Welcome back and I hope you’re ready for more lines of code. 
[Last time we talked about the basics of Clean architecture](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/getting-started-with-clean-architecture-for-android-part-1) and how it can help you separate the domain and presentation logic. Now, it's time to get more advanced.
Keep reading and find out how the modules are wired together with Gradle, how Dagger Hilt provides the dependencies, and how to implement the presentation layer in the app module.
### Gradle files
Before we get into the app module that wires everything together, you need to understand the Gradle files of the other modules first. They'll make dependency management clearer and demonstrate depending in the direction of stability.
```
plugins {'java-library''kotlin'}{=.=.}
```

Let’s start with the domain module’s Gradle file, as shown above. You can see that it doesn’t have an androiddependencies
```
plugins {'java-library''kotlin'}{=.=.}{project(':domain')// Network""com.google.code.gson:gson:$versions.gson""
    implementation ""com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:$versions.retrofit""
    implementation ""com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:$versions.retrofit""
    implementation ""com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:$versions.okhttp""
}
```

The auddrecognizer module’s Gradle file is a bit more complex, but don't let it scare you off. It's also a pure Kotlin module as it doesn't need any Android APIs to implement network communication. It depends on the domain module because it implements its SongRecognizer
```
plugins {'com.android.library''kotlin-android''kotlin-kapt'}{31{24311""1.0""

        testInstrumentationRunner ""androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner""
        consumerProguardFiles ""consumer-rules.pro""
    }{{falsegetDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt')}}{true..}{=""11""
    }}{project(':domain')// Room""androidx.room:room-ktx:$versions.room""
    implementation ""androidx.room:room-runtime:$versions.room""
    kapt ""androidx.room:room-compiler:$versions.room""

    // Core library desugaring""com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:$versions.core_library_desugaring""
}
```

The roompersistence module’s Gradle file is the most complex so far, but only because Room depends on the Android framework. Since the code in blocks pluginsandroiddependenciesSongSaverSongGetter
To implement the abstract behaviors of the domain module, roompersistence and auddrecognizer need to depend on it. This is a clear example of depending in the direction of stability – the volatile code depends on and molds itself around the contracts set by the stable code. This way, when the volatile code changes, the stable code will remain unaffected. It also doesn’t need to be recompiled, and this will save you build time.
### The app module
Every program needs an entry point that starts its execution. One of the simplest ways to achieve this is in command line apps, which often have a main function that initializes the program's dependencies and then runs, taking and displaying input and output text. Android apps will go a few steps further and provide a graphical user interface that does similar things but in a more user-friendly way. They implement conventional main function behaviors with Android-specific mechanisms, like Activities, Fragments, and Services. These user-facing classes initialize dependencies, gather input, and display output with Views in many different and attractive ways.
In other words, Android code is like a complex main function. It should provide every dependency, react to user input and render the output. It’s also highly prone to change due to external events like Google deciding to deprecate an API, or a library deciding to remove a feature that you depend on.
Remember, none of these things are in our control. They all happen because a third party decided so, and your only option here is to adapt. That is why the main code, and by extension Android code, is the most volatile code in Clean Architecture. By comparison, the changes in the domain code occur only if our project team wants them to. Therefore, you should completely separate your domain code from Android. Keeping them independent will allow you to modify them separately. To do this, you need to put all of the code that concerns Android and dependency management into the app module.
```
└── app
    ├── HortonApp.kt
    ├── di
    │   ├── AppModule.kt
    │   └── ViewModelModule.kt
    ├── presentation
    │   ├── coroutines

    │   │   └── DispatcherProvider.kt

```

You can see its directory structure above, and here are three top-level packages:
  * di
  * presentation
  * uiMediaRecorder

```
plugins {...}{...}{project("":roompersistence"")project("":auddrecognizer"")project("":domain"")// Room""androidx.room:room-ktx:$versions.room""

}
```

This is its Gradle file. The pluginsandroiddependencies
### Dependency injection
Theoretically, dependency injection is a low-level implementation detail that is only a more sophisticated way of constructing and providing the dependencies your code needs. Therefore, it should be easy to replace and you shouldn't pollute your codebase with it. A class shouldn't know that its dependencies are injected with any particular library nor that it will be a singleton, for example. This is not its responsibility – it should only know that it can get its dependencies from its constructor. But putting this theory to use can result in a considerable amount of boilerplate code.
To make all the other modules agnostic of the way their dependencies are injected, we need to exclude @InjectAuddSongRecognizerRecognizeSongUseCase
```
@ProvidesfunprovideSongRecognizer(:):{returnAuddSongRecognizer()}@Provides@ViewModelScopedfunprovideRecognizeSongUseCase(:,:):{returnRecognizeSongUseCase(,)}
```

Although it's not the worst thing that can happen on some smaller projects, you should ask yourself this on bigger ones: are you willing to sacrifice the ease of use @Injectjavax.injectjavax.inject
### ViewModels
The last piece of the puzzle is connecting the created use cases to ViewModels that will map their data to UI models, which can be displayed with your library of choice. The thing that interests us here is bridging the gap between the domain and UI layers.
```
@HiltViewModelclass@Injectconstructor(privateval:,privateval:):ViewModel(){privateval=mutableStateOf(RecognitionScreenState())val:<>get()=funstartRecording(){.launch{.=..copy(=false).start()recordingCountdown()recognize(=.stop())}}privatefunrecognize(:){.launch{.=..copy(=.)val=.recognize()if(is.){.=..copy(=.,=.Recognized(..mapToSongUiModel()))}else{.=..copy(=.,)}.=RecognitionScreenState(=..,=..)}}// omitted recording helpers}
```

Here we can see the RecognitionViewModel
  1. Record audio for recordingCountdownsampleDuration
  2. Invoke the use case by passing it the newly-recorded audio file
  3. Map its result to the screen state
  4. Post this state to a mutable state object which the UI can react to


The ViewModel only serves to kick off use cases, map their response to UI data and expose it to the view in a lifecycle-aware way. This is what most ViewModels should look like in Clean architecture - they're the glue between your UI and domain logic.
In this case, the ViewModel embodies both the controller and presenter components of Clean Architecture.
### Conclusion
And that’s it! I hope you enjoyed part 1 and part 2 of the article, and learned something new. Even though you can use the structure from this post, I strongly recommend reading the book as well. Before I read it, I molded my personal projects around the libraries that I would use. Now, I think of their purpose and requirements first, and only then pick the libraries to match. 
This is a very important paradigm shift that'll make your code more stable, testable and flexible. If you could use more of that in your projects, wait no longer, and read the book!

# How Atomic Design Can Make Your Life Easier
Tomislav
Web Developer
Hello fellow reader! You know that situation when you get on board with an on-going project and then, all you find is chaos? The project structure is *disastah* so you try reusing components but it’s nearly impossible, or it takes more time than creating them from scratch. After finding zillion lines of duplicated code, you finally get the courage to ask yourself: “Should I stay or should I just go?”. Well, I’d tell you to run, BUT, you can try to refractor/re-create the project structure using Atomic design! Not only will it make your life easier, but also the life of every next developer that joins the project. You’re welcome. 😄 
### Atomic Design?
Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages.Atomsmolecules  organismstemplatespages
I'll explain each stage soon, but as you can assume, it's similar to chemistry. Atoms combine together to form molecules, molecules combine further to form relatively complex organisms etc.
Atoms
Each atom has its own unique properties, like dimensions of an image or the font size of a primary heading. In the context of a pattern library, atoms demonstrate your base styles, which helps with maintaining your design system.
But it’s important to note that atoms come to life only with an application.
MoleculesSearch form molecule
The label atom now defines the input atom. Clicking on the button, the atom submits the form and the result is a simple, portable, and reusable component that can be dropped anywhere a search component is needed.
Burdening a single pattern with too much complexity makes a software unwieldy. How can you change that? Easy, by creating simple UI molecules, which’ll encourage reusability, make testing easier, and promote consistency through the interface.
Organisms
a) groups of molecules and/or 
b) atoms and/or
c) other organs. 
These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.
Let's go back to our search form molecule and put it into the context of a header organism with other elements, like a logo image and navigation. Now the header forms a standalone section of an interface.
Finally, we can say that organisms demonstrate smaller and simpler components in action, and serve as distinct patterns that can be reused.
A template
When a template like that undertakes the implementation of the content, it becomes an instance of a composition which we call **a page**
So now when you have a better understanding of Atomic design, let's see how we can use it to create our design system in the project.
The design system doesn't need to be ready before we start creating the React app - it can have basic components and grow as the app grows. However, elements that must be ready are those elements, the page we’re creating, consists of.
I won't guide you through the whole process, I'll just show you the final result - how the app structure should look like when using atomic design. 😊
In the structure above, the pages are outside of the components folder, since a page is not a component and it should be closer to the service layer of the app.
### To sum up, why should you use Atomic design?
For me, this is the most effective way to build things out of smaller, focused, and independent pieces. It gives you a possibility to shift between abstract and concrete.
With Atomic design, you can see what interfaces that are broken down to their atoms look like, and how, when combined, they create the form of the final product.
Further on, it offers you a number of major benefits like:
  * Faster prototyping
  * Easier updates and revisions
  * Improved consistency
  * Less cross-checking while testing
  * Eliminated errors
  * System acts as a single source of truth


That’s a wrap! I hope this post helps anyone who’s structuring projects from scratch to be more organised and efficient.

# How to Build a Free Discord Bot With Node.JS
Damir
Backend Developer
In this tutorial, you will learn how to connect a bot to the Discord server and create commands that it will respond to. To achieve this, you will use Node, Typescript, DiscordJS, and dependency injection(InversifyJS). But before we start, let’s talk about the benefits Discord offers. 
Every day we have more and more VoIP services to choose from, but most gamers have already decided on Discord for communication. Today, not only gamers but agencies and companies started using Discord. Why? You may ask. Because it offers everything that business communication platforms, such as SlackRocketChat
  * Is free to use, 
  * Provides out-of-the-box solutions without much setup or configuration, 
  * Is perfect for larger teams, as it offers text and voice support for a great number of people


Note: Discord, along with all of the features we will be using in this tutorial, is free to use.
Before we begin with the tutorial, I assume you have the basics of Typescript and a beginner level of understanding NodeJS. It is also recommended you are at least at an intermediate level of Javascript. Since you will be using NodeJS, having an environment set up on your PC will help you follow the code. To finish this tutorial you will also need a Discord account, so if you don’t have one, please create it.
To summarize, in this tutorial, you will learn:
  * How to create a Discord server and a bot
  * How to add a Discord bot to your server
  * How to set up Node project with Typescript superset
  * How to use Dependency Injection with InversifyJS
  * How to create business logic for bot commands with DiscordJS
  * How to test commands through the Discord channel‍


Note: If you want to skip ahead to the final project, check out the code in my .
### Setting up the project 
For the IDE, you can use whatever you feel comfortable with - for me, that is Webstorm. Before creating a bot, you need to create a project. To do that, use the following command:
##### npm init
This will open an interactive process for initializing your project with the package.json
After initializing the project, install the following dependencies by running this command inside your project (terminal):
##### npm i --save discord.js dotenv typescript inversify @types/node reflect-metadata
Then for the last step of setup, you need to change scripts inside the package.jsonstartwatch
We will use the start watch **package.json** file should look like after your changes:
##### { ""name"": ""discord-bot"", ""version"": ""1.0.0"", ""description"": """", ""main"": ""index.js"", ""scripts"": { // here ""start"": ""node dist/index.js"", ""watch"": ""tsc -w -p tsconfig.json"" }, ""author"": """", ""license"": ""ISC"", ""dependencies"": { ""@types/node"": ""^14.14.37"", ""discord.js"": ""^12.5.3"", ""dotenv"": ""^8.2.0"", ""inversify"": ""^5.0.5"", ""reflect-metadata"": ""^0.1.13"", ""typescript"": ""^4.2.3"" } }
Now that you have set up the scripts, it is time to define the TS compiler for your project.
### Defining Typescript compiler
Create tsconfig.json
""experimentalDecorators"": true,
""emitDecoratorMetadata"": true,
""resolveJsonModule"": true
tsconfig.json
##### { ""compilerOptions"": { ""module"": ""commonjs"", ""moduleResolution"": ""node"", ""target"": ""es2016"", ""lib"": [ ""es6"", ""dom"" ], ""sourceMap"": true, ""types"": [ ""node"", ""reflect-metadata"" ], ""typeRoots"": [ ""node_modules/@types"" ], ""experimentalDecorators"": true, ""emitDecoratorMetadata"": true, ""resolveJsonModule"": true }, ""exclude"": [ ""node_modules"" ] }
We are adding experimentalDecoratorsemitDecoratorMetadataes6reflect-metadataindex.tssrc  console.log(“Hello”)
index.ts
##### console.log(“Hello”)
If everything is correct, run npm run watch src/index.jsnpm start 
The next step is to create a Discord app and connect a Bot to your server.
### Creating an application on Discord
Our goal is to communicate and work with the Discord server, but before you do that you need to create a Discord bot that will connect to the server.
To create the bot, first, you need to sign in to Discord and create an application. You can do that by visiting 
Clicking the New ApplicationNAMECreate
Now, you should see an Application screen with the possibility to enter information about the application - you can skip it for this tutorial.
To create a bot, click BotAdd BotYes, do it! 
A page, including the token
‍
### Creating and adding a Discord bot to your server
To work with and later on test your bot, you need a Discord server. You need to either create a new Discord server or use an existing one. Whatever you decide, connecting will look the same.
To add the bot to your server, follow these steps:
  1. Copy APPLICATION_ID General Information 
  2. Change APPLICATION_ID in the 
  3. Open the URL in a browser of your choice to start the authentication process.
  4. Authorize the process of adding the bot to the server through the steps provided by Discord.
  5. Once the bot is successfully added, you will get a message in the default text channel. 


Now that you have added a bot to the server, it is time to set up the environment in your project.
### Saving variables in environment files
To safely provide a token to our application, we are using the **dotenv** package. You need to get the Bot token from the Discord Application developer dashboard. It is located at Bot > Click to Reveal Token. After you have the token, you need to safely store it in the **.env** file in the following way:
##### DISCORD_TOKEN=paste.the.token.here
One more thing we need to create for the future is the .env.example **.env** file. Inside of the .env.example place:
##### DISCORD_TOKEN=
### Dependency Injection Container
For an easier understanding of dependency injections, you should already have a solid
In our case, we use InversifyJS for dependency injections, and that is why we need to create our DI containerinversify.config.ts
##### import ""reflect-metadata"" import {Container} from ""inversify"" import {TYPES} from ""./types"" import {Bot} from ""./bot"" import {Client} from ""discord.js"" let container = new Container() container.bind(TYPES.Bot).to(Bot).inSingletonScope() container.bind(TYPES.Client).toConstantValue(new Client()) container.bind(TYPES.Token).toConstantValue(process.env.TOKEN) export default container
One more thing we need to do for dependency injections is to define types. This will give us the security to not have name collisions with containers. Even though it doesn’t matter that much for us in this tutorial, it is good practice to follow the clean architecture and best practices even when developing a project like this.
types.ts
##### export const TYPES = { Bot: Symbol(""Bot""), Client: Symbol(""Client""), Token: Symbol(""Token""), }
### Creating a Bot Class 
We will create bot.ts
##### import {Client, Message} from ""discord.js"" import {inject, injectable} from ""inversify"" import {TYPES} from ""./types""
##### import {CommandResponder} from ""./services/command-responder"" @injectable() export class Bot { private client: Client private readonly token: string constructor( @inject(TYPES.Client) client: Client, @inject(TYPES.Token) token: string ) { this.client = client this.token = token } public listen(): Promise < string > { this.client.on('message', (message: Message) => { console.log(""We got message, it says: "", message.content) }); return this.client.login(this.token) } }
After this, you can add the bot to index.ts:
##### require('dotenv').config() import container from ""./inversify.config"" import {TYPES} from ""./types"" import {Bot} from ""./bot"" let bot = container.get(TYPES.Bot) bot.listen().then(() => { console.log('Logged in!') }).catch((error) => { console.log('Oh no! ', error) })
With this done, we have created our basic logic and we can start the project and connect the bot with the Discord server.
##### node src/index.js Logged in! We got message, it says: Test
These are your project foundations. The next step is to develop the logic for listening and responding to messages.
### Responding to messages
Now, you need to create the logic that listens to certain types of messages and responds to them accordingly. Specifically, you want the bot to listen to two commands: !who and !roll. These two commands will make the bot introduce himself and roll one number between 1 and 100. ‍ Then, you need to create two classes - CommandListener and CommandResponderCommandResponderBotCommandListenerCommandRespondersrc/services
##### import { injectable } from ""inversify"" @injectable() export class CommandListener { private regexp = ['!who', '!roll'] public isWhoCommand(string: string): boolean { return string.search(this.regexp[0]) >= 0 } public isRollCommand(string: string): boolean { return string.search(this.regexp[1]) >= 0 } }
You can inject that to command-responder.tssrc/services
##### import {Message} from ""discord.js"" import {CommandListener} from ""./command-listener"" import {inject, injectable} from ""inversify"" import {TYPES} from ""../types"" @injectable() export class CommandResponder { private commandListener: CommandListener constructor( @inject(TYPES.CommandListener) commandListener: CommandListener ) { this.commandListener = commandListener } handle(message: Message): Promise { if (this.commandListener.isWhoCommand(message.content)) { return message.reply('I am bot that is made to demonstrate connection between NodeJs and Discord.') } if (this.CommandListener.isRollCommand(message.content)) { const rolled = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1 return message.reply(`You have rolled ${rolled}`) } return Promise.reject() } }
And then, the BotCommandResponder
##### import {Client, Message} from ""discord.js"" import {inject, injectable} from ""inversify"" import {TYPES} from ""./types"" import {CommandResponder} from ""./services/command-responder"" @injectable() export class Bot { private client: Client private readonly token: string private commandResponder: CommandResponder constructor( @inject(TYPES.Client) client: Client, @inject(TYPES.Token) token: string, @inject(TYPES.CommandResponder) commandResponder: CommandResponder) { this.client = client this.token = token this.commandResponder = commandResponder } public listen(): Promise { this.client.on('message', (message: Message) => { if (message.author.bot) { console.log('Ignoring my own or other bot messages.') return } this.commandResponder.handle(message).then(() => { console.log(""A response sent!"") }).catch(() => { console.log(""There was an error with sending a response."") }) }) return this.client.login(this.token) } }
One last thing to do is creating new DI containers and types for CommandResponderCommandListener
Remember how you bound containers before for tokenBot,Client CommandResponderCommandListener
inversify.config.ts
##### container.bind(TYPES.CommandResponder).to(CommandResponder).inSingletonScope() container.bind(TYPES.CommandListener).to(CommandListener).inSingletonScope()
You also need to add these two types, so that you don’t create a bug by the last addition to the inversify.config.ts.types.ts
types.ts
##### CommandResponder: Symbol(""CommandResponder""), CommandListener: Symbol(""CommandListener"")
And voila! Your Discord bot is ready to listen to your two new commands and respond to them accordingly. The only thing left to do is to restart the app and test the bot.
After testing our commands, this is the response you get:
This is the response you should expect - it shows everything works as developed.
### What’s next?
First of all, congratulations! You just made it through the whole article and (hopefully) learned how to do a Discord bot. But you might say - OK, that's cool and all. But what can I do with it? 
If you have any questions or ideas regarding this blog post, please feel free to reach out. And most importantly, have fun coding! :)

# From Manual to Automated Testing: Tailoring QA to Your Needs 
Lana
QA Engineer
In today’s digital era, software quality is more important than ever. Users expect smooth, fast, and straightforward applications for their everyday tasks, hobbies, etc., which leads businesses to search for reliable and bug-free solutions to stay competitive. That's where Quality Assurance comes into play. 
At COBE, QA is more than just finding bugs — it's about ensuring software meets expectations, delivers value, and provides a positive experience for businesses and end users. But how do we achieve this? The answer lies in both manual and automated testing — two approaches that can work separately and together to ensure software quality.
### Manual Testing
Simply put, manual testing is when QA engineers interact with the app directly, simulating real-world scenarios, like entering data, clicking through features, and validating the user interface and the user experience. 
They engage with the app just like a real user would — exploring, experimenting, and making sure everything works as it should. What's so great about manual testing is that humans can spot issues automation might overlook, from visual glitches and usability problems to unexpected user behaviors.
#### What Makes Manual Testing Irreplaceable
The human perspective is essential for effective testing, especially when unexpected issues pop up. A great product isn’t just bug-free — it also needs to be intuitive, user-friendly, and practical in real-world scenarios. Manual testing ensures your app actually meets real user expectations. Here are some key areas where manual testers make the biggest impact:
  * Exploratory and ad-hoc testing:
  * UX/UI and visual testing:
  * Adaptability to change:
  * Edge cases & complex scenarios:happy path
  * Usability & accessibility audits: 


#### The Downsides
As you can tell by now, manual testing is pretty flexible and adds a human element that can't be replaced. But it's worth noting that it has its own set of challenges, just like anything else. 
First off, it’s time-consumingresource-heavy
There’s also the human side 
The good news is that these challenges can be tackled with smart testing strategies that create the most cost-effective approach tailored to your project’s needs. QA engineers know that bugs tend to show up in clusters, so taking a risk-based approach lets them focus on the areas that really matter first instead of testing everything equally. This is where a hybrid approach comes into play, which I’ll dive into later.
#### It’s Story Time!
Now, let me tell you about a time when manual testing saved the day. While testing a checkout process during UX/UI validation on one project, I realized automated tests had already given it the green light. They confirmed that the process worked as expected — the user could apply the discount code with no issues. However, what manual testing revealed was that applying and reapplying a discount code resulted in incorrect price calculations. Just imagine the complications for users if that app had gone live without us catching that issue.
This situation explains perfectly why manual testing is essential for new feature testing, UX reviews, frequent UI changes, short-term projects, and complex scenarios that require human judgment.
### Automated Testing
Imagine having to manually click through every single feature of an app just to make sure nothing breaks. Sounds exhausting, right? That’s where automated testing comes in.
Automated testing uses scripts and tools to run tests without the need for human interaction. Instead of relying on human testers to repeat the same steps, automation allows us to quickly and consistently validate the core functionalities, detect regression, and assess performance on a scale. This results in speeding up the releases, minimizing the possibility of human error, and ensuring application stability as it evolves.
#### Best Test For Automation
Automation really shines through when tests need to be fast, repetitive, and data-driven 
  1. Regression testing:
  2. Smoke & sanity testing:
  3. Performance & [load testing](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/how-to-perform-load-testing-using-jmeter):Black Friday
  4. API testing:
  5. Data-driven testing:
  6. Repetitive & high-volume tests:


Automating the regression tests we run in every cycle really changed things for us. We've cut down the testing time, which allowed us to catch more bugs than before. Faster testing means we get feedback sooner and can release updates earlier each week. Plus, our team can now focus on manual testing where it matters the most, making our regression testing even more effective.
But here’s the thing — automation is not suitable for exploratory testing, UX/UI validation, one-time or rapidly changing features, and usability/accessibility testing because, as said before, they still need a human touch. 
###  Customizing QA for Your Needs
Testing isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, so deciding which path to take for your project can be challenging. When choosing between manual and automated testing, you need to consider multiple factors such as:
  * Project size and stability:
  * Test frequency and repetitiveness:
  * Time constraints:
  * Budget and resources:
  * User experience & business impact:
  * Compliance & security requirements:
  * Existing tech stack & tools:


#### Finding the Right Balance 
The sweet spot? A hybrid approach[Mixing manual and automated testing](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/the-power-duo-why-manual-and-automated-testing-are-both-essential) allows you to automate the repetitive, time-consuming tests and leave usability, exploratory testing, and real-world user interactions to human testers. This way, you get the efficiency of automation without losing that human touch
### Quality Assurance: A Shared Responsibility
If there's one piece of advice I would give to teams looking to improve their QA process, it's this: Prioritize collaboration and communication between development, QA, and other stakeholders from day one.
Quality assurance isn’t just the QA team’s job — it’s a shared effort across the entire development lifecycle. When developers, testers, and stakeholders work together early and often, testing aligns better with your business goals, technical needs, and user expectations.
Here’s why this approach is so important:
  * Bringing QA into the process early, even in the planning stages, allows testers to understand requirements, clarify expectations, and help shape the product design. This reduces the chances of issues being discovered late in the development cycle, which saves your budget and time
  * Quality can hardly be achieved in a silo. By keeping open lines of communication, teams can make smarter decisions about test coverage, automation, and issue resolution.
  * Manual and automated testing work best together.


In short, fostering a collaborative mindset across teams leads to a more efficient, productive, and aligned QA process, ultimately resulting in better product quality.
At COBE, we know that great QA is all about balance. Manual and automated testing each has its strengths, and what's important is to know when to use which one. By strategically implementing a hybrid approach, our team can maximize efficiency, catch more bugs, and deliver beautiful user experiences for your projects. Whether it's the irreplaceable human touch of manual testing or the speed and scalability of automation, each contributes to your ultimate business goal. Technology will keep evolving, but the core principles of quality assurance remain the same: delivering value to our team and your end users.

# Get Ahead of the Game With These iOS Summer School Tips
Vanesa
UX/UI Designer
Summer is almost here and it only means one thing – we're back with our iOS Summer School! If you're an iOS enthusiast and a COBE fan, chances are it’s not your first time hearing about it. However, if you're new to the scene, let us introduce you to our paid internship program where you’ll have the opportunity to develop your programming skills and gain some valuable experience. So, let's dive in and discover what awaits you. Our program offers three months of intensive tutorials, coding and meetings to help you build your expertise and gain valuable experience in the field. But don't just take our word for it – we spoke with last year’s interns and asked them to share their thoughts and learnings. Continue reading and find out what they said. 
### 1. Jump into the unknown, you may like it
Starting a journey with a completely new language, tools and team members can be scary, to say the least. But with the right guidance and support from our mentors
So, let’s hear about it from first-hand experience! What can a new intern expect from the internship in the first few weeks? Matko: The start itself was quite interesting for me – meeting the whole team, and having everyone welcome us with open arms. Of course, there were times when I didn’t understand a thing, but getting out of my comfort zone was one of the best decisions I made for myself. I suggest you do the same. 
Miran: As we were unfamiliar with Swift, learning a new system and programming language was a challenge, and it took us a few weeks to adapt. But as time passed, we got more comfortable with it, watching tutorials and working on given tasks.
With our iOS team by your side, everything becomes a breeze. After the whole adjustment process was done, what was your focus in the following months?Laura: During the first month, we delved deep into all topics related to the **UIKit** with Paul Hudson and his tutorial, . The tutorials are well structured, with the first five days devoted to watching and studying the material, and the remaining two days focused on applying what we learned to a related project. Some YouTube channels helped out as well, like the  one. 
Matko: After we tackled the UIKit, we jumped right into **SwiftUI**. We found it way more user-friendly and intuitive, which made our development process much smoother and easier. We kept up with the same approach as before – watching videos, taking on smaller projects, and leaning on our mentor for help when we needed it.
### 2. Be independent, but know when to ask for help too
Of course, our mentors will be here for you every step of the way, but we believe that fostering a sense of independence is important too. Therefore, we encourage you to spread your wings, take responsibility and explore your own unique solutions. 
What would you say, why is it important to explore things on your own before reaching out to your mentors? Miran: During the whole process of finding all possible solutions to a certain problem, you’re actually engaged in research and that’s how you gain your independence. Although mentors were always there to jump in when we needed them, we wanted to explore on our own first before asking. When you learn something on your own, that experience leaves a profound imprint on your memory.
Now, don’t think you’ll have to do everything on your own. No one expects you to become a Swift master overnight, and sometimes finding a solution will look impossible. And that’s okay. After all, you’re here to learn, right? It’s important to find a balance between independence and knowing when you need help. When did you find yourself reaching out to your mentors for assistance?  
Laura: If there was something we couldn't grasp from the video alone, our mentors had our back. Watching a video might make everything seem crystal clear, but when it comes to applying that knowledge to assigned tasks, it’s not that easy. They really came through in those moments.
### 3. Be curious and never quit
After completing tutorials, dealing with different kinds of tasks, and tackling two iOS frameworks, our interns faced an exciting project. The project allowed them to showcase and apply all the knowledge from their internship journey. 
We're curious to know which tasks effortlessly fell into place, and which ones pushed the boundaries of your skills. Could you tell us a little bit about the project? Miran: We created a mobile app similar to IMDb, enabling users to search for movies, which we pulled from the API. We also implemented features like favoriting movies and creating a movie presentation. Designing the application's UI came naturally to us, but writing clean and functional code, especially in a new programming language, was more demanding. What we learned from this project is that there are rarely ideal project circumstances and requirements, you’ll always have to adapt to a certain situation. But, when faced with challenges, it’s important to discuss them with your team, as someone may have a similar experience and knows how to deal with the problem. 
And what about those problems where it seemed like there was no solution? How did you approach the situation? Matko: With some problems, you just have to be patient and persistent. First, try finding solutions online. If that doesn't do the trick, reach out to your colleagues or mentors. And if that still doesn't help, give it some time and sleep it off and let your subconscious do its magic. Time solves everything, trust me.
## 4. Build relationships and master your communication skills
Now, let’s talk about the importance of networking. Besides gaining valuable iOS skills and knowledge, don’t forget to take time and connect with your mentors, fellow interns, and other employees. Use these three months as an opportunity to train your soft skills as well – engage in conversations, attend company events and build professional relationships for the future.
You mentioned previously that you found the office atmosphere very welcoming, and we’re so glad to hear that. Was it the same within the iOS team? With Mladen’s undying love for coffee, did you have a chance to connect with your mentors and grab a cup sometimes?
Miran: Well, I was personally amazed by the fact that every single person in the office would stop, say hello and chat. Speaking of our mentors, we really felt like a part of the team. Of course, we bonded over “a few” coffee and lunch breaks. But what’s even better is that we also had a chance to actively participate in team syncs. We listened to their invaluable project insights and experiences, but we also talked about ours – we were thrilled to discover that our opinions and ideas were warmly welcomed. 
Sounds like you enjoyed your time at the office then. Would you say you preferred coming to the office or working from home? Laura: I’m glad that we got the freedom to choose our preferred workplace, it shows mutual trust. I also discovered I’m way more productive within the office environment. Working from the office is quite dynamic, plus you get the opportunity to connect with people from other teams and areas. 
## What now?
Armed with these valuable tips and pieces of advice from our last year’s interns, the only thing that’s left to do is to start your own iOS journey. Good luck! 🍀

# How to Amaze Users With Memorable UI Images
Petar
UX/UI Designer
First impressions are important, both in life and in product design. Today, users are always on the move – rushing through online stores, news portals, social media… That’s why we, as designers, often have just a few seconds (or even milliseconds) to grab their attention. That short amount of time usually determines whether someone will continue scrolling through your website or leave.
I know this almost seems like an impossible task, but don’t worry – we have a solution. Actually, our ancestors have developed a secret weapon to catch users' attention, and they did it 40 000 years ago. It’s called images.
Source: deviantart.com
Even they knew a thing or two about the smart use of visual assets.
Amazing visuals can distinguish a digital product from its competitors, and when it comes to first impressions, UI images are the ones that truly make the difference. Since humans respond faster to visual data rather than to any other type of data, nothing will evoke our emotions quite like a great image. Think of National Geographic, for instance. Their photographers are successfully using images to tell stories and attract attention for more than 130 years!
So why wouldn’t we do the same? Continue reading and discover how to find UI images for creating beautiful interfaces. 
### Set the stage for imagery in your early UX design process
The research and conception phase of the product design is the time when you should start thinking about organizing and presenting information in a smart and likable way. 
The look and feel of a website or app have everything to do with a product's visual expression and identity. Since visual identity and user experience go hand in hand, it’s important to think about the layout of images on the screen and their context early in your design process – when sketching or wireframing.
Wireframing will set the stage for future graphics, while first giving focus on the usability of your experience. Later in the process, you’ll want to see the full expression and impact of selected images on the users. 
Don’t forget to think of different screen sizes – your images need to fit and adapt. Your image layout and selection has to look good both on big and smaller screens. Also, always mind the context – use images to guide users or support the story you’re trying to tell.
### Make your images relevant
Why do we even use images? Besides showcasing a product, and displaying a specific scenario, you can also create a wow factor and trigger a strong emotional response. In this process, it’s important to consider context, find relevant images, and provide value to the targeted audience. Because of that, when choosing UI images, please consider the following questions:
  * Who's your target audience?
  * What device are they most likely to use, and in which conditions will they use your product?
  * How should you align the visual elements you use with the guidelines of the brand they represent?


Let’s assume you’re designing an app for a construction company. This app should help workers use and control machines on a construction site. How would you answer the questions above? Your user is a construction worker, as we have just defined. He needs an app that’s easy to access and use at any time, and he must be able to use it anywhere on the construction site.
All this information should give us an idea about the user's device. Since a mobile phone is the only device that fits all the criteria stated above, you'll need to design a mobile app. This app will be used both indoors and outdoors, so we need to consider choosing UI images that will be well visible in different light conditions. They should have enough contrast with the background and not be too small. Also, consider using bigger buttons to make our usually ‘big thumbed’ construction workers life easier.
In this case, you should choose niche-related and product-related UI images combined with the brand colors and typography. Images should always support the screen instructions and clarify the product we’re showcasing.
If you choose images with a deeper understanding of your user and human psychology, the product will be more useful in real life and receive higher user acceptance. You can give your design a more genuine sense by using niche-related photos; Irrelevant or random images will not help you in creating clarity.
### Make your images stand out
Surely you already know there are some great sources of quality images, vectors, and illustrations online. Even some Figma plugins can help you create good looking user interfaces. But as designers, we should all strive to add some magic to our UI elements to make them more memorable. ‍ There are several techniques for manipulating UI images and different ways to add some personality and professionalism to our designs. If you manage to do just that, I’m sure the user's relationship with your brand will be stronger, and your products will become more memorable.
#### Technique one: Add dynamic to the gallery layout
Instead of using the same size photos, vary the size when designing a photo gallery preview. It will add dynamic to the gallery layout and look so much better.
#### Technique two: Tightly place high quality images together
High-quality photos placed next to each other can look awesome too. But, keep in mind that the quality, style, and colors should match and be compatible. Also, try to leave out any margins, it will instantly look a lot better.
#### Technique three: Use image elements in the background
Actually, it’s really fun to use this technique. Scan your UI image for interesting details or shapes, and then extract them and use them as emphasized elements of the background.
#### Technique four: Use color overlay or light effects on the image
A color overlay is a great tool when you’re trying to align the look of the UI photos with the brand they represent. Also, you can use some light effects to make photos look more professional and interesting.
The first (left) photo below is a default photo. The middle one shows the default photo overlaid with a purple linear color gradient. Finally, the photo on the right shows the default photo with color overlay and light effect applied (ellipse filled with a multi-color linear gradient with different opacities):
#### Technique five: Clip image to shape – collage technique
I like to call this technique the collage technique. It’s great for designing stunning hero photos or banners. And how should you use it? 
Well, first, you'll need to create several shapes, fill them with photos, apply the same fancy color overlay, and maybe add some noise layers to make the photos perfectly blend. Place clipped and styled image layers on the background that matches and blends well with their color – and voilà! You've just made a beautiful collage hero photo. 
### Always use high quality images
Quality design requires using high-quality assets – especially UI images. It doesn't matter if you found the amazing font and aligned elements on-screen pixel perfectly, it can all be ruined with a bad photo or photo background. 
Remember – people are drawn to a crisp, high-resolution image. They're easy on the eyes and can be completely mesmerizing. Also, keep in mind that the text should always be readable and legible.
#### Where to find high-quality images?
There are a lot of different options for finding or producing high-quality images. If it's possible, keep it authentic. So when a client has the budget – hire a photographer. You can even participate in photo sessions and direct the photographer to produce the photos exactly how you and your client want them to look and feel.
Another great source of quality images is online resources and tools. Be careful not to use cliche stock photos everyone's using, dig a bit deeper. Find quality images, and don’t forget to use the design techniques listed above to make them adhere to your design guidelines.
Here is a list of my favorite online resources:
  * Unsplash plugin for Figma‍
  * Content Reel plugin for Figma‍
  * Photos plugin for Figma‍
  * Freepik
  * ‍Shutterstock Premier 


#### Optimize images
After you've found desired images, please mind their size and don’t forget to optimize them.
It's recommended not to use images bigger than what you need, so export assets in the same size your design requires. If your website requires banner image of 1200x600 px dimensions, export it as a 1200x600 px sized image. If you're working with an original image of higher resolution (ex. 300 PPI), make sure to optimize its resolution to 72 PPI and color mode to sRGB. If you expect your users to predominantly use devices with retina screens – double the image size (2x).
Depending on their purpose, you need to save images in one of the following formats – .jpg, .gif, or .png. The most common image format for your website will be .jpg, as they're the lightest in size. And that’s it. Congratulations! 
Or did you?
Some of my favorite ones are:
These optimization apps will help you optimize images even better, and your site will be faster. Believe me, users will appreciate it.
### To conclude
Okay, let's go through the key points one more time. First of all
Secondly
And last but not least
I hope my tips will help you create more memorable UI images and bring even more value to your product. If not from me, take it from our ancestors and always keep in mind the impact of visual data.

# How Playing Sports Can Help Your Future Career
Katarina
Marketing Lead
Playing sports from an early age influences and shapes your life in ways you couldn’t even imagine - any professional athlete can confirm this to you. Even though COBE isn’t a sports agency, a lot of our colleagues have an enviable career in sports too. If you’re curious about how their sports lives affected their careers today and what qualities they developed through years of training, keep reading. 
### May I have your attention, please?
Let me introduce you to the magic 10.
  1. Dolores, QA Engineer — Handball and football
  2. Ines, Managing Director — Handball
  3. Ivan, QA Engineer — Athletics and football
  4. Saša, iOS Developer — Handball
  5. Luka, Android Developer — Football
  6. Mladen, CTO — Football
  7. Nikolina, Lead QA Engineer — Basketball
  8. Tomislav, Lead Web developer - Football
  9. Josipa, Lead Product Owner - Handball
  10. Milan, Project Manager - Football


A lot of these people have more than 15 years of sports experience - do you know what that many years of training does to a person? Other than getting you into amazing shape, duh. It teaches you discipline, hard work, communication. That’s why hiring an athlete, a current or former one, should never be neglected. Having zero work experience in your CV due to spending all your free time in practice is not the same as choosing not to work. 
Why is it so important to be an athlete in the tech industry, you might ask. I mean, the kind of sprints we run here don’t even require running shoes. All jokes aside, this is not related to the industry you work in — whether you’re a salesperson or a developer, the skills you gain during your athlete days will always have value.
Let’s go back to the 10 people we mentioned above who played sports for a big part of their lives. I know that ten is maybe not a huge number, but it’s still big enough to recognize similar qualities these people provide: ‍
#### 1. Leadership 
Just like the captain of a basketball team knows what’s best for his team, a former captain, now in a completely different field of work, can still recognize if something’s wrong with their team. At COBE, that’s Nikolina - basketball player for 18 years, today leading a Quality assurance team in an IT agency. She knows exactly what and how her team is doing and what issues they’re dealing with — at any time. That’s what 18 years in basketball does to a person. It also gives you certain bellicosity to fight for others and to provide other teammates with bigger things - better benefits, job positions, salaries.
#### 2. Responsibility
When you’re a professional athlete, you don’t get a lot of time for mistakes. Your average week includes practice two times a day, every day. And the thing is, you can’t miss out or be late. Ines, our Managing director, never missed her handball practice, even when she was sick or had a test to study for (don’t worry, she finished school in time). That’s why it doesn’t surprise me that she's never late for a meeting, and she shows up for the team even when she doesn’t have to.
#### 3. Teamwork
What do you think, why is being a team player almost always a requirement in a job ad? Well, can you imagine someone not wanting to communicate with the team they’re working with? Not wanting to help out when there’s an important situation? Us neither. Luka, our Android developer, has this perfect team player quality and knows exactly what it takes to be a part of a team and how to distribute goals and roles — a thing he learned playing football for 15 years. He’s 26 now and retired from football, but still going [strong in mobile development](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services/app-design-agency).
#### 4. Always wanting more
I’m sure you’ve seen a professional runner once or twice in your life, at least on TV. If you’ve ever seen one practicing, you must’ve noticed how they, after completing one lap of the track, always hype themselves into running another one. That’s the equivalent of giving your 110% into a project. I know people at our agency that will, if a sprint lasts 10, always try to end it in 9 days. One of those people is our Product owner Josipa. She’s always going above and beyond for our clients and our team. 
#### 5. Trust
Trusting your teammate during a game is so important — imagine running on the football field, not knowing who you can pass the ball to. But trust isn’t just that, it comes in all forms and shapes. Trusting someone means being there for your team, even when you feel like you can’t. Everyone has those days when they’re physically or mentally just not present, but somehow manage to work. So if you see someone struggling, show that you are there for them. Help them. Talk to them. 
#### 6. Respect
Another thing playing sports teaches you is respect. Respecting your coach, your teammates, and time. When you’re preparing for a competition, there isn’t a lot of time to waste, so being on time is a must. And even though nobody mentions it in job ads, being on time is a big plus when hiring too. How you treat someone, whether it’s during a game, or in the workplace, tells so much about you as a person. And learning how to be respectful from an early age helps with maintaining that behavior throughout your life.
#### 7. Patience
Every once in a while, someone new joins the team, and let’s be honest, it takes a while for them to fit in. The important thing is to accept them, encourage, and acknowledge that some people take more time than others in overcoming issues and figuring things out.
### Look at the bright side
Now, what do you think how do athletes develop all these skills and qualities, especially at such a young age?
Well, some of you might have had strict parents, but imagine having a coach that watches your every move, criticizes you, and gives you instructions on a daily basis. Does it annoy you at times? Sure, but you know you both want what's best for you. This is what helps you grow thicker skin and build character. 
Eventually, you start seeing criticism as a way of improving yourself. Nobody’s yelling at you because they want you to quit — they’re raising their voice because they see potential and they want you to grow. Now, this is how you learn to deal with pressure my friend. 
Furthermore, training teaches you how to deal with injustice. Just like game scores can be set up and nothing you do can change the results, clients could easily reject you just because you don’t speak german, for instance - even when you’re the best candidate for their project out there.
You're left with two options then — you either allow it to break your spirit, or say f*** it, it’s their loss. Pro tip; always choose the second option.
### What’s your opinion? 
Please don’t get us wrong, we’re not trying to bash employees that don’t have an athlete background — especially not at COBE. Culture and sharing values is a really big thing for us, so the qualities mentioned above apply to almost every person in the agency, whether they're into sports, or not. ‍ But the focus of this article is to emphasize what athletes can offer, other than work experience. Although you might not consider training to be a job, for some of them this felt like a real job, and their coach was like a boss to them. ‍ I mean, if they showed loyalty to their club for 15+ years, who’s to say they won’t do the same for your agency?
And if you’re a former athlete, who randomly ended up looking for a tip in this article, here’s one; mention your sports background when you’re applying for a job. Let your future employer know how much time and effort you have spent in practice and show them you’re a hard worker. It will pay off.

# How to Choose the Right CMS for Your Business
Antonio
Frontend Developer
Choosing a content management system (CMS) plays a big role in your digital presence. Whether you're a startup, a global enterprise, or a growing e-commerce brand, the CMS you pick will impact how efficiently you create content, how fast your site loads, how scalable your infrastructure is, and even how well you rank on search engines. 
Keep reading to learn how to choose the right CMS for your needs.
### What you need to know
Let's start with the basics. A CMS is essentially the behind-the-scenes control panel for your website. It's where you write blog posts, update your ""About Us"" page, add new products, and manage everything that visitors see on your site, all without needing to know how to code.
Think of it like the dashboard in your car. You don't need to understand how the engine works to drive, but you definitely need controls to get where you're going.
A good CMS can be a game-changer for a company. For example, your marketing team can launch that time-sensitive case study without waiting for the dev team to free up, customer service can update FAQs on the fly when the same question keeps coming up, and your e-commerce manager can adjust pricing for flash sales in real time.
### Traditional vs. headless CMS: decisions, decisions…
The CMS world has basically split into two categories, and understanding the difference might save you money in the long run.
#### Traditional CMS
Think WordPress, Drupal, Joomla. These are the platforms that have been around forever. They bundle everything together: You create content and immediately see how it looks on your website. A simple concept, and it works well for straightforward websites.
The good stuff:
  * Get up and running fast
  * What-you-see-is-what-you-get editing (perfect for those with no developer skills)
  * Tons of themes and plugins available
  * Usually cheaper to get started


The not-so-good:
  * Hard to use the same content across different platforms
  * It can get slow when traffic picks up
  * More security vulnerabilities because there's more code
  * Customization often means fighting with the system


#### Headless CMS 
A headless CMS separates your content from how it looks. You manage content in one place, and then it gets delivered via APIs to your website, mobile app, smartwatch, etc. It's like having a content warehouse that can stock any type of store.
Platforms like Payload CMS
Why do people love them?
  * Fast performance
  * You can use your content everywhere (website, app, digital signage)
  * More secure because there's less attack surface
  * Future-proof, works with whatever tech comes next
  * Developers actually enjoy working with them


The catch:
  * Higher upfront investment
  * You need some technical knowledge
  * Content creators need to adjust to a different workflow


### Industry-specific CMS recommendations
Although there isn't a universal CMS, here are some tailored suggestions:
  * For e-commerceSanityContentfulStrapi
  * For small businessesWebflowGhost, [Directus 9](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/choosing-your-next-headless-cms-keep-an-eye-on-directus-9). ‍
  * For healthcare or financeDotCMSContentStack,Crafter


### Don't make these common mistakes
  1. Going for the cheapest option


That $5 hosting deal sure can look tempting until you realize you need premium plugins, security add-ons, and developer time to make everything work. Free and cheap options are fine for personal blogs, but company websites have different requirements and different stakes. Always consider the total cost over 3-5 years, including all the extras you'll probably need.
  1. Forgetting about mobile


More than half of your visitors are probably using mobile devices, and this percentage is growing every year. If your CMS doesn't deliver a great mobile experience, you're basically telling potential customers to go elsewhere, and they will.
  1. Underestimating content migration


Moving your existing content to a new platform is like moving houses; it always takes longer and costs more than you think. URLs change, formatting breaks, images go missing, SEO rankings disappear, and functionalities stop working. Even with the best migration tools, there's always manual work involved. Plan ahead and set a budget. 
  1. Skipping training


Even the most user-friendly platforms require some learning, and most platforms aren’t as easy to use as they claim. Factor in training time for your team, or you'll have expensive software that nobody knows how to use properly. Invest in proper training from the beginning. It's one of the best ROIs you'll get from your CMS investment.
### Security: Don't let your guard down
Security should be at the top of your priority list, not something you think about later. Here’s where things usually go wrong:
#### The plugin problem
Third-party plugins are sometimes great, but sometimes they fail miserably. Regularly audit what you have installed, remove anything you don't use, and keep everything up to date. Every plugin adds code to your site, and every piece of code is a potential security vulnerability. More concerning, many plugins are created by developers who don't follow security best practices, don't update regularly, or abandon projects entirely.
#### Weak authentication
Most breaches happen because someone's password is ""password123."" Don’t be that person. 😀Make sure to use strong passwords, enable 2FA, and limit access to what people actually need.
#### Data protection must-haves
If you're handling sensitive data, look for:
  * Encrypted storage (so your data is protected even if someone gets in)
  * Secure APIs (the doors to your content)
  * Regular security audits
  * Compliance certifications that matter for your business
  * Well-set permission controls


Payload CMS addresses a lot of these concerns right out of the box with encrypted fields, role-based access control, and API-level security that many older platforms struggle with. But the key is in understanding that security isn't a feature you add later; it needs to be built into the foundation.
#### Making your site accessible
Building websites that everyone can use isn't just nice, it's legally required. Your CMS should make it easy to follow [WCAG 2.2 AA guidelines](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/why-accessibility-is-no-longer-optional-preparing-for-the-eaa), some being:
  * Clean HTML that screen readers can understand
  * Keyboard navigation support
  * Good color contrast tools
  * Easy alt text management for images
  * Proper heading structures


Look for platforms that help your content creators follow accessibility best practices without needing a computer science degree. The best accessibility features are invisible, they just work.
#### AI and the future of content management
As we move into 2025 and beyond, CMS platforms are increasingly adopting AI to augment content workflows. AI-powered tools can help generate headlines, summarize blog posts, suggest SEO improvements, and automate alt text generation for images. More advanced platforms allow for natural language content queries, AI-generated media assets, and predictive analytics that guide editorial calendars.
Even more promising is how AI integrates into the CMS workflow itself. Editors can auto-translate content into multiple languages, generate accessibility descriptions on the fly, or even receive insights on what type of content performs best by region or audience segment. These features are especially useful for small content teams working with limited resources.
### What CMS should I pick then?
Choosing the right CMS means balancing business needs, content workflows, technical skills, and long-term scalability. Below is a focused comparison of four popular platforms: Magento, Shopify, WordPress, and Payload. Each serving different types of organizations.
#### Magento (Adobe Commerce): Enterprise e-commerce powerhouse
Magento is an e-commerce platform with deep customization options, mostly used by large retailers with complex product catalogs and business rules. Now part of Adobe Commerce, it offers advanced features but requires significant development resources.
Strengths:
  * Extremely customizable e-commerce engine
  * Supports multi-store, multi-language setups
  * Rich extension ecosystem


Limitations:
  * High cost of ownership (hosting, dev resources, maintenance)
  * Complex to implement and maintain
  * Can be overkill for smaller businesses 


This option is best suited for large enterprises that need highly customized e-commerce workflows, product configurators, and complex integrations.
#### Shopify: User-friendly SaaS for e-commerce
Shopify is a fully hosted e-commerce CMS that allows companies to launch online stores quickly, without needing to manage infrastructure. It’s ideal for startups and small businesses that prioritize ease of use over full backend flexibility.
Strengths
  * Fast to launch with built-in hosting
  * Simple UI and great for non-technical users
  * Extensive app marketplace


Limitations
  * Limited backend customization
  * Subscription and app fees can add up
  * Difficult to break out of Shopify’s ecosystem for custom needs


This is a great fit for small to medium-sized e-commerce businesses looking for a fully equipped, ready-to-use solution that requires little developer involvement.
#### WordPress (with WooCommerce): Flexible but plugin-heavy
WordPress remains a dominant CMS, especially when paired with WooCommerce for e-commerce functionality. It offers flexibility through themes and plugins, but is often misused as a one-size-fits-all platform, which can create performance and security challenges at scale.
Strengths
  * Massive theme/plugin ecosystem
  * Strong community and support
  * Familiar UI for marketers and editors


Limitations
  * Security vulnerabilities via plugins
  * Performance issues with complex sites
  * Difficult to scale beyond standard use cases 


This one’s for content-heavy sites, blogs, or small e-commerce setups with limited technical demands.
#### Payload: Developer-first, scalable, headless flexibility
Payload is a modern, headless CMS built with TypeScript and Node.js. It’s designed for developers who want full control of the backend, while also offering a powerful admin panel for editors. Payload can serve as the content backbone for anything from custom ecommerce platforms to SaaS products or multilingual marketing sites.
Strengths
  * Code-first schema definitions for ultimate flexibility
  * Built-in authentication, access control, file management
  * Headless architecture with REST/GraphQL APIs
  * Easily self-hosted or deployable to cloud environments
  * Developer experience is central, but editor UX is also polished


Limitations
  * Requires a developer to set up and customize
  * Not a plug-and-play solution


This one’s best for startups and enterprises building custom digital products, e-commerce platforms, or scalable multilingual applications where flexibility, performance, and security are top priorities.

### Conclusion
As digital projects continue to grow and spread across websites, apps, and other platforms, teams require more flexible tools to keep pace. That’s where headless CMS platforms come in. By separating the content backend from the frontend, they give developers the freedom to build using modern tech while letting content teams manage everything in one place. They're highly customizable, great for delivering content anywhere (from websites to smart devices), and easily connect with tools for SEO, translations, and even AI-driven workflows. 
Think about your team's skills and capacity. The most powerful platform in the world is useless if your team can't figure out how to use it effectively. Plan for growth, but don't over-engineer for problems you don't have yet. It's better to choose something that can grow with you than something that's overly complex from day one.
Whether you go with a traditional platform for simplicity, a headless solution for flexibility, or something modern like Payload CMS for its developer-friendly approach and extensibility, success ultimately depends on thoughtful evaluation and proper implementation.

# From a Male to a Female Domain?
Norina
Marketing Manager
The 8th of March is International Women's Day! So I, as a woman, took the opportunity to ask our founders about the steadily growing proportion of women at COBE. How could a four-all-male-startup become an 80-person team, with a lot of female leaders? As COBE approaches its tenth anniversary, the first look back goes to the development of a former male domain into an agency where gender equality is not just a word, but lived.
### The original state
“You have to think of it like this: Here in the office, guys used to ride around on their skateboards, we shot each other with Nerf Guns, and the tone was a lot rougher.” That was the answer to the question of what COBE was like when our Chief Happiness Officer, Dominik “Bubu” Bernhart, had his first day in 2018. Typical men, still a bit stuck in their puberty, you might say.
Of course, the point is not to slip into any statements about gender stereotypes, even if that cannot be avoided from time to time. We are looking at the change within the agency that has taken place, with no small amount of female influence, at COBE.
**What has changed since then?**
No matter whom you ask, whether it's the founders Felix van de Sand and Daniel Wagner, Bubu or the one who also witnessed the beginnings, Felix “Menz” Menzel, the changes are noticeable – and almost without exception positive. Where before there was more appearance than reality, there is now more depth. If you ask Felix, the “facade” is gone. “The purely masculine egotism no longer exists. It's not so cool anymore, but in a positive way. The coolness has given way to a warmth and cordiality that would probably not have existed without our female colleagues. Right from the start, you could sense that a kind of balance was developing. That did us guys a lot of good, because it also made us more serious.”
The transition wasn't entirely smooth, though. “Pamela was a real culture shock for us men,” interjects Daniel, “and that is not meant negatively at all. It was simply a change in the culture we, as an all-male-startup, were used to at the time. It was a little different, more diverse.”
### The growth
‍
A wide variety of characters gather under the roof of COBE.
> ""We have many characters with different backgrounds. And it doesn't matter whether they are men or women. What you do notice is that the more mixed the teams are, the more perspectives naturally open up. That all has an impact on the issue of diversity. There are more angles, and more angles are always beneficial."" -Daniel Wagner
**Keyword profession: Do you notice an increase in professionalism?**
It's not uncommon for appearance to become more serious as the years go by. As empathy increases, so does attentiveness. What used to be started in a rapid-fire, spontaneous action is now much more thoughtful and purposeful. Coincidence? “My impression over the last few years has been that women are better prepared for deadlines and tasks, which increases the quality of output. Whether this is due to naturally growing professional experience or a female influence remains to be seen. But it's safe to say that quite a few women work in a more orderly and structured manner compared to some of the men,” sums up Menz.
Another positive development is the increasingly heterogeneous talent market. In the office, this has been strongly felt in recent years, as Daniel tells us: “It's as if a gate had opened and all of a sudden millions of women came into the field of UX/UI.” What was still a novelty at universities five to six years ago is now an established degree that women are also increasingly studying.
### The actual state
There is not only harmony and concord at COBE. Due to the special focus on the community – e.g. cooking together, game nights, summer tips —, tensions cannot be avoided. With an organizational model like Holacracy, there is naturally more friction, communication is not hindered by hierarchies. As a result, there is also more often no mincing words, but in a different way.
> ""Men work differently with each other. Communication is rougher, but certain topics remain unspoken. Women communicate more. They sense subtle tensions sooner and address them more readily.""-Felix Menzel
It was precisely such topics as Mindfulness that were initially shaped and driven more by the women. And the male team members seem to welcome this development very much.
> ""The collaboration is very pleasant. The women at COBE all have thick skins and like to dish it out themselves. There is no sign of reticence towards men in general or the managing directors in particular. And that's exactly how it should be!"" -Felix van de Sand
**Does it come through COBE? Or does COBE gather these characters?**
“I would say that we attract a certain type of people, but it has nothing to do with gender. It's just a cultural fit. We have a very good mix there.” So the time-honored adage “it's the mix that counts” proves true for Menz.‍
**There are many women in leadership positions at COBE. Is there a particular reason for that?**
“For leadership positions, you have to have a lot of empathy and sensitivity. That could be one reason why we have a lot of female team leaders. But another is definitely the skills they bring to the table.” And that's important, not only for Felix, but because there's no quota to fill. Their skills have gotten them to where they are now.
Ines celebrates her 5th anniversary at COBE.
One woman at COBE in particular can be highlighted in this context: Managing Director Ines. “In Osijek, it was clearly Ines who gave the team a boost with her vision and skills.” Word of praise from Daniel. Something Felix also clearly underlines: “She sees the bigger picture and knows how to create a culture of trust. She is the link that has welded the team together through her convictions.”‍
### From male to female domain
**So has COBE become a woman's domain?**
As if shot out of a pistol, you hear from all the men: “Absolutely!” Without even a hint of hesitation.
It is diversity in general that is in the foreground: “Gender should no longer play a role for us. Socially, structures must be created so that everyone has the same opportunities. Unfortunately, that is simply not yet the case. When that is achieved, the ideal state will occur. That means: as long as the social, structural conditions are not yet like that, we have to consciously make sure that equal opportunities prevail.” A nice concluding sentence from Felix, in my opinion.

# How AI and Automation Go Hand-in-Hand with DesignOps
Tim
Head of UX/UI
As organizations grow, so do their design teams – and with that growth comes complexity. Who’s in charge of what? How do we efficiently delegate tasks? What’s happening? It’s all ripe for chaos.
Look at it this way – have you ever worked on a group project? Then you know things can easily become chaotic when working in big enterprises with multiple design teams across different departments. DesignOps is here to simplify design work and make sure everyone’s on the same page.
### Improving efficiency with DesignOps
You could say that DesignOps, with the help of tools, brings automation into the design process. Let’s take a look at design systems as an example. Instead of every designer creating their own buttons or card components from scratch, they can simply reuse existing ones. This saves a lot of time and keeps things consistent across different products.
With a clear workflow and shared tools, everyone can be on the same page – not just within the design team but across other departments. [Efficient communication means less delay and smoother work](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/how-to-successfully-collaborate-in-multi-company-projects). Who wants to attend another meeting, anyway?
If you think DesignOps could be a good fit for your team, check out our recent blog post, where we break down[what DesignOps is](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/what-is-designops-and-why-your-business-needs-it)
### The role of AI in DesignOps
It might feel counterintuitive, but [AI is making a big impact on the creative process in design](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/the-impact-of-ai-technology-on-design), speeding up everything from user research to wireframing. You don't have to start from scratch anymore and stare at the blank screen because AI can provide a good head start by generating initial wireframes or designs that you can easily iterate on.
In the early stages of design, tools like **Figma Make** and **MiroAI** can offer inspiration and wireframing suggestions. For example, you can input a prompt, and the AI will generate a wireframe concept for you. This not only saves time but helps designers focus more on refining and improving the design rather than starting from zero.
When it comes to user research, automated notetakers can analyze your user research data and help identify patterns. AI can even assist in unmoderated user testing, asking follow-up questions based on users' responses. This can help simplify the analysis phase and uncover insights more efficiently.
AI also shines during the design phase. Tools like **Stark** automatically scan designs for accessibility issues, offering suggestions to improve inclusivity. As for generating style guides, AI can look at your existing design and create a style guide based on it, saving designers time and effort.
AI tools are also beneficial where there's a need for quick, efficient design processes across multiple teams. Platforms like **Attention Insight** can even perform eye-tracking studies to see where users focus most on a webpage, helping optimize designs based on real user behavior. Benefits like this especially come into play when working with big enterprises. For us, this was helpful when working with **BMW**.
An example of a prompt in UX Pilot.
However, when it comes to later stages, especially with more complicated environments like the initial customer journey, AI has some limitations. Still need a human to get the job done!
Using AI tools isn’t about making things easier but about DesignOps teams implementing the right AI tools into the workflow to enhance the design process, ensuring teams work efficiently and productively. Used the right way, AI tools can be game-changers. 
### AI tools in action
You might be thinking, isn’t design a creative process? Wouldn’t AI tools take away from creativity? Oftentimes, when you’re starting out with an outline, you’re doing very similar things. Look at using AI like starting with a template
For example, for one project, I had to create an initial customer journey, and instead of starting from scratch, I used an AI tool. I fed the tool all the necessary project details, and it quickly generated an outline for me. Then, in Figma, I was able to use a template, which made building the customer journey super quick. Without that AI help, it would have taken me much longer to reach the same point.
Another example was a more complex project where we were implementing an AI bot based on a knowledge base. Instead of scrolling through tons of links or searching endlessly, the AI bot could directly answer any questions about the tool. It provided step-by-step guidance, so if someone was unsure about how to do something, the bot would walk them through it. This made the whole process much smoother and helped people understand the tool faster.
In both cases, AI sped things up and made the work more accessible
When it comes to integrating AI and automation into the design process, it’s all about staying informed and finding the right tools that truly add value to your workflow. There are so many new tools coming out all the time, so it’s important for DesignOps and design teams to keep an eye on these developments. The key is to identify which tools actually make the team more efficient and help improve the overall design process.
### Challenges and future trends
Integrating AI and automation into design workflows certainly comes with its own set of challenges, especially when there's some resistance to new technologies. Don't think AI will magically solve all your problems. You first need to have the right data, train the team, and have human oversight over AI to ensure the output is spot-on.
The key to success is choosing the right AI tools
One trend to watch out for is the shift away from focusing solely on screen design. Instead, design will become more template-based, relying heavily on existing design systems. This approach will make processes faster and allow designers to explore their creativity within more structured guidelines. There’s always something new to learn when working with limitations!
With all that said, while implementing AI into design teams and workflows is inescapable, it’s important to remember design itself won’t be replaced by AI anytime soon
Ultimately, the creative aspect of designing cannot be done without a human touch, and AI will be here to merely help streamline the process and make things more efficient.
### Nothing without a human touch
At the end of the day, robots can’t replace humans. Not yet, anyway. When it comes to DesignOps, it’s important to focus on enabling designers to keep the human touch in their process while working efficiently together with AI tools. While AI can be an amazing tool for brainstorming or testing out new ideas based on user feedback, it should never take over the collaborative, human-to-human exchange that’s so crucial in design.
As designers, we still need to engage directly with users, [understand their needs](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ux-research-agency), and keep the conversation going. Automation shouldn’t mean isolating ourselves from the people we're designing for. AI can enhance the process, but it can’t replace the importance of those real, human connections. After all, robots don’t know what we want, and that’s what designers are finding out – but they can help us get there.

# Getting Started With Clean Architecture for Android [Part 1]
David
Mobile Developer
Talking to my fellow Android developers, there was always one book that would come up in our conversations – Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design by Uncle Bob. To see what the fuss was all about, I gave it a try a few months ago. And guess what? I'm a fan now too.
To be completely honest, I've never come across Clean architecture before. This book inspired me so much though that I decided to develop an app which follows its principles. In the end, the best way to illustrate what Clean Architecture looks like in a project is by going over an example app. But, keep in mind that this is only my book interpretation and it may differ from yours. Nothing wrong with that – in fact, I'd love to hear back from you once you finish the article.
### Clean architecture 
My main misconception with Clean architecture was in thinking of it as another architectural pattern like MVP or MVVM, which I can apply in the same way regardless of the requirements. But it's actually a set of guiding principles that different teams can interpret in different ways. For example, you can recognize MVP and MVVM whenever they’re present because they follow a specific pattern – there'll be a repository of some sort (Model), a presentation layer (Presenter or ViewModel), and a View. You’re supposed to fit the app's requirements into these templates. The main draw of these patterns is that they unify the way in which the code is written within a team, which makes it much easier to develop, upgrade and fix.
Clean architecture extends these patterns mostly by changing the way we construct the Model layer. In fact, it applies a whole new architectural pattern to it. This is the most important layer of your app because it contains its business rules, which define the unique way your app generates output data from a user’s input.
Just a look at this layer’s directory structure should convey what the app does. Uncle Bob compares this to looking at blueprints of buildings. When you see the floor plan of a house, you instantly know it’s a house. It has a living room, a couple of bedrooms, and a kitchen – its purpose is to be a living space. Similarly, the way you organize your code and name your high-level classes should convey the app's purpose. 
### Sample app
Now, let’s get down to business. For this purpose, I created a Shazam-like music recognition app with the following requirements: 
  1. Recognize songs from recorded audio files
  2. Display a history of recognized songs


It may look simple at first, but it will showcase a couple of important concepts when applying Clean Architecture to Android development. Find the source code for it 
### Why clean?
‍ There are a couple of ways to recognize songs embedded into audio files. The most popular one uses a database that associates a song’s sonic fingerprint with its metadata (title, artist, cover art, etc.). This fingerprint encodes the sonic characteristics of a song, which means it's flexible enough to be matched against audio files similar
Some providers of these services, like Shazam, perform fingerprint generation on-device. It's a very privacy-friendly feature since you can't recreate it into the original sound. Others, like Audd, require sending the audio file to their servers. But they all have one thing in common – they take audio as input, perform some magic, and deliver a recognized song. It's the app’s first and foremost use case.
How the app performs this magic shouldn’t be set in stone. Since this isn’t a first-party app where we cooperate with a dedicated backend team to deliver a mobile solution, any of the chosen providers can decide to change their API, which would leave us stranded. This is why we need to separate the app’s business rules from the way it gets data. And that's exactly where Clean architecture steps in.
### Modules
In his book, Uncle Bob talks about the concept of ""depending in the direction of stability"". This means that each part of your app’s code should depend on code that’s more stable than itself. Stable code is less likely to change than some other code. The two requirements I mentioned earlier should be the most stable parts of the entire app. 
The well-known thing to every Android developer is that the tools for implementing these requirements, such as network and database communication or the Android framework, change frequently. When that happens, the rest of the app’s code needs to adapt. Of course, changing more code than you need to is never a good thing. To mitigate this, you should abstract the tools behind a more stable interface.
Java interfaces and abstract classes in a single-module project are great for this task. However, there's one downside – a new developer could accidentally bypass the agreed-upon architectural boundaries, since all project files are visible to him. Luckily, Gradle modules prevent this by denying a developer access to its code and forcing him to respect the architectural boundaries. We can divide this project into four Gradle modules, which approximate Uncle Bob’s Clean architecture, with some simplifications.
```
Modules
    - app
    - auddrecognizer
    - domain
    - roompersistence

```

The domain module is the most important one. It encapsulates the entity and the use case layers from the book, which means it contains the app’s business rules. The entity layer could have been a separate module, but it would only contain a single data class with no methods. To simplify, I merged it into the domain module. But for more complex projects with multiple entities, those modules can be separated. It’s also a pure Kotlin module independent of the Android framework, which gives it two very attractive properties:
  1. Testability. You can test pure Kotlin code independently of the Android framework, which reduces complexity.
  2. Reusability. You can reuse the domain module and its business rules on any platforms that support Kotlin.


The domain module doesn't depend on any other module. Instead, all other modules depend on it. This is what makes it the most stable component and a natural candidate for the project's backbone. It has no outside reason to change, and the fact that all other modules depend on it discourages change even further.
### The domain module
In Clean architecture, use cases are representations of an app’s requirements in code form. They take input and transform it into output in a way specific to the app. They are in the domain module and are the only concrete implementations inside it. The rest are interfaces implemented by the other modules to provide concrete behavior. 
```
classRecognizeSongUseCase(privateval:,privateval:){val:=.suspendfunrecognize(:):{val=.recognize()if(is.){try{.save(.)}catch(:){// Ignore this because saving to history is not critical}}return}}
```

Here I implemented the use case’s input port with the method’s input parameters and the output port with the suspend
You can see a code snippet of the app's central use case above – the RecognizeSongUseCasesampleDuration
It has two dependencies. SongRecognizer
SongSaversomewhere
```
└── domain
    ├── entities
    │   └── RecognizedSong.kt
    ├── persistence
    │   ├── SongGetter.kt
    │   └── SongSaver.kt
    ├── recognizer
    │   └── SongRecognizer.kt
    └── usecases
        ├── HistoryUseCase.kt
        └── recognizesong
            ├── RecognizeSongResult.kt
            └── RecognizeSongUseCase.kt

```

This is the domain module's directory structure. The entitiespersistencerecognizerusecases
### The recognizer and persistence modules
For the domain module to work, it needs to be injected with concrete implementations of its interfaces. The auddrecognizer module provides AuddSongRecognizerSongRepositorySongSaverSongGetter
```
classAuddSongRecognizer(privateval:):{overrideval:=.ofSeconds(5L)overridesuspendfunrecognize(:):{val=try{.recognize(buildAuddRequestBody())}catch(:){return.NetworkError()}returnif(.==null){.}else{.Success(..mapToEntity())}}privatefunbuildAuddRequestBody(:):{...}}
```

In the code snippet above, you can see that AuddSongRecognizerrecognizeSongRecognizer
```
classSongRepository(privateval:):,{overridesuspendfungetAll():<>{return.getAll().map{->.mapToEntity()}}overridesuspendfunsave(:){.save(.mapToRow())}}
```

Next, you can see that SongRepositorythe database is merely a way to persist entities
A more complex app would likely have more modules like these that provide implementations of abstract domain behaviors. For example, if this app supported playback of recorded audio snippets, the module could have another use case called PlaySnippetUseCasePlayerPlayer
All good for now? Hope you're keeping up. As we still have a lot of work, let’s take a break here. To learn how to tie the modules together and display the use case results, [read part 2](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/getting-started-with-clean-architecture-for-android-part-2).

# How to Build a Design System
Pauline
UX/UI Designer
What is a design system? What are its benefits? How do you build one? If you had asked me these questions as a student, I would have likely answered it’s the CI guidelines used as a foundation for creating a product — which isn’t wrong. However, I only began to understand the true extent of a design system after several years of professional experience. The first insight I gained is that it's not just set up at the beginning and then forgotten; rather, it’s a constantly evolving companion. In this article, I’ll explore why design systems are crucial for modern organizations and help you build one, step by step.
### What Defines a Design System?
A design system is more than just the basic setup of CI principles and more than a collection of UI components. It's a framework
#### The Benefits
If a system isn’t in place or is poorly set up, a company is faced with two major challenges. The first is directed toward internal processes The second challenge affects the end consumer's perception
Companies without a design system often face common issues like inconsistencies, sometimes even in basic elements like colors and fonts across products. These inconsistencies and design changes can lead to confusion, making it difficult for customers to navigate your brand due to varying experiences. In the long run, this can leave users feeling confused and perceive your brand as unprofessional, ultimately reducing the trustworthiness of the product or company. If this sounds familiar to you, it might be time to implement a design system.
Having a design system has always been important — this isn’t something new. It takes over the task of managing design at scale by reducing redundancy and creating a common language and visual consistency across different sites and channels. Take Apple 
And yes, a proper, well-thought-through design system may take some time to set up, but once it's in place, the key benefits are clear. Here’s what you can expect:
  1. Having a single source of truth for branding:
  2. Reducing repetitive tasks: 
  3. Improved collaboration across teams and minimizing misunderstandings: 
  4. Streamlining onboarding processes: 
  5. Paving the way for rebranding or scaling and growth: 
  6. Maintaining consistency across platforms: 


Let’s face it; In today’s digital world, design systems have become even more essential. As companies grow larger and more complex, a solid design system makes it easier to manage the visual storytelling of your brand. When set up correctly, it simplifies the process of scaling, integrating tools like AI, and automating workflows. It essentially becomes the foundation for everything your company does
### Core Features of an Effective Design System
The key elements that every design system should include can be grouped into several categories, from foundational elements to more complex patterns. A design system is a living document that evolves with your organization. However, there are some key elements that design systems should include.
The Foundation
This may be common knowledge, but for the sake of clarity and because it’s important to begin with strong core building blocks that define a product’s visual and interactive identity, here’s a breakdown: 
  1. Color palette
  2. Typography:
  3. Spacing and layout: 
  4. Iconography:
  5. Imagery and illustration


As I’ve already mentioned in the first part, all points mentioned above should be checked and documented for accessibility aspects as well. Accessibility standards **WCAG Accessibility Guidelines,** which contain topics like color contrast, text resizing, keyboard navigation, etc. 
The foundation, which represents the brand guidelines should, of course, also include the tone of voice, logo appliance, and animation and motion guidelines.
UI Components
Now, this is a set of reusable, functional components that form the interactive elements of the UI, all while adhering to the visual principles. 
The base consists of small componentslarger componentseven larger components
Once you create the components, they should be precisely documented. What do the different states look like? Ideally, the states should also be aligned across components in order to create a recognition value for the user. What’s the behavior and usage of the component? Along with descriptions, include the do's and don'ts — especially regarding accessibility — and integrate Figma or Storybook examples to make the design more concrete and practical.
### How to Get Started with Your Design System
Implementing a design system is a structured process that requires careful planning, collaboration, and continuous iteration. A design system is never truly finished; as your company evolves, so should your design system. Instead of trying to implement the entire system all at once, take a step-by-step approach. 
Scope and Necessity:
  1. Define MVP and usage goals:
  2. Secure stakeholder buy-in:‍
  3. Cross-functional collaboration: 


The Setup:
  1. Conduct a design inventory:
  2. Document the brand guidelines
  3. Build the component library:
  4. Provide detailed guidelines:
  5. Integrate tools:
  6. Start small:
  7. Implement gradually
  8. Promote adoption
  9. Encourage collaboration:
  10. Continuous maintenance and updates: 
  11. Assign ownership


All in all, I can recommend finding a good balance between very precise but also very simplified documentation, thus creating no room for discrepancies. 
### A Strategic Investment in Your Company’s Future
A well-implemented design system drives innovation, improves user experiences, and supports the company’s growth. By reducing repetitive tasks, streamlining onboarding, and maintaining consistency, you’re making a strategic investment in the long-term success of a digital product.
If you’re ready to take the first step towards building or refining your design system — or you just want to discuss a different opinion with me on the topic, feel free to reach out.

# How to Audit an Existing Product for Accessibility
Amela
QA Engineer
With the digital world evolving fast, one thing has become clear: accessibility is no longer optional. It's not just good design practice or a gesture of inclusivity anymore; with the EAA coming into effect in June, it's now a legal and business priority. Or, at least, it should be. 
Despite increasing awareness, some still don’t invest sufficient time in [the accessibility topic](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/why-accessibility-is-no-longer-optional-preparing-for-the-eaa). This happens because, historically, accessibility has been treated as an enhancement, something to deal with after the core features are done. And for existing products that have already been launched and matured over time, it can feel overwhelming to even know where to start. 
So if that’s where you are, keep reading because this article can help. We’ll take a look at what accessibility audits are, why they matter, how to run them, and how to build a path forward from the results.
### Where to start when your product isn’t accessible?
Let’s say you already have an app on the market, you launched it back in 2019, and everything’s going super well. However, when you first built it, you didn't take all accessibility guidelines into account. So what happens now? 
This is where an accessibility audit comes in. An audit is a structured review of your product that evaluates how well it aligns with established accessibility guidelines, but even more importantly, identifies if the app is suitable for users with disabilities and those who rely on assistive technology. The goal of an audit isn’t just to catch issues; it’s to understand where your product falls short, how it affects real users, and how to fix it. It usually results in a list of issues that need to be addressed to make your product compliant – this allows your team to make informed decisions, whether that’s planning a full accessibility overhaul, fixing things incrementally, or prioritizing high-impact areas first. Think of it as a medical check-up for your app; you want to make sure that people with a wide range of limited abilities, devices, or needs can use the app as intended.
Now, with the EAA being in effect, there’s a certain pressure in the air to get this done as soon as possible. But the good thing is, we’ve been dealt some breathing room – five years to be exact. Meaning, if you have an existing product on the market that doesn’t comply with accessibility standards, you have a five-year grace period to become fully compliant. However, if you’re making any updates, adding new features, or redesigning your app, you have to meet compliance requirements. 
### So, what does an accessibility audit actually involve?
An audit typically begins with defining its scope – this means deciding whether it’ll cover the whole product, a specific platform, or certain sections of a site. Once you define the scope, you move into testing, starting with automated scans. For this, we use automation tools like [automation can only go so far, and that’s where manual testing](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/from-manual-to-automated-testing-tailoring-qa-to-your-needs) takes over. 
Manual checks often begin with something simple, like adjusting the font size to see how the app handles it. This small change often exposes broader accessibility flaws. From there, testing expands into the use of assistive technologies, such as screen readers (VoiceOver for Apple devices and TalkBack for Android), magnifiers, and keyboard-only navigation. For web testing, we prefer native screen readers, like VoiceOver on Mac. You want to make sure that interactive elements are labeled correctly so that the reading order makes sense and the error messages (and other feedback) are accessible. Depending on the context of the app, you may also use additional tools like on-screen keyboards, color adjustment, and contrast-changing utilities.
A full audit includes more than just functional checks – think typography, contrast ratios, interface responsiveness, and overall user experience. Throughout all phases of an audit, every issue is logged, categorized, and linked to relevant standards. Once we finish testing, the client receives a detailed report outlining each issue, its potential impact, and recommendations for resolution. What the audit doesn’t include, however, are direct fixes to design or code, or in other words, it suggests fixes but doesn’t implement them. The report is often followed by a presentation and Q&A session to ensure everyone involved understands the results and next steps.
### The reality of retrofitting accessibility
Accessibility efforts in existing products are complicated by technical debt, outdated frameworks, and years of layered design decisions, quick fixes, and custom components. What seems like a straightforward fix often detects deeper issues – from non-semantic code to inaccessible components or libraries that don’t support modern accessibility standards. Because accessibility wasn’t considered from the start, every change carries the risk of unintended consequences, making retrofitting both time-consuming and pricy. In many cases, it feels like doing the work twice. But it doesn’t mean it’s impossible. 
With the right approach, you can, step by step, fix a lot of issues. Accessibility audits play a crucial role here, helping you identify and prioritize high-impact improvements, such as [fixing missing alt text, ensuring proper keyboard navigation](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/fixing-the-most-common-accessibility-issues-in-web-development), correcting heading structures, improving contrast ratios, and strengthening screen reader support. These targeted changes can significantly improve usability without destabilizing the product. However, not every product can be salvaged through patches. Legacy CMSs, heavily customized frameworks, and aging libraries often reveal structural limitations that make true accessibility compliance nearly impossible. In these situations, redesigning or refactoring becomes the more sustainable and cost-effective option. Unlike patchwork fixes, a redesign allows accessibility to be integrated from the ground up; aligning design, architecture, and testing with best practices from day one. Integrating accessibility checks into CI/CD pipelines further ensures that compliance isn’t treated as a one-off project, but as a continuous practice where new issues are detected and resolved early in the development process.
Ultimately, the difference between introducing accessibility into an existing and a new app comes down to efficiency and control. Retrofitting means working within constraints and balancing risk against impact, while a fresh build offers the opportunity to create an accessible product by design. Knowing when to patch and when to rebuild is often the most critical decision of all.
### Building accessibility into your team’s workflow
You get the idea; however, your experience with accessibility is still pretty limited. If there’s one piece of advice I’d give to any team starting their accessibility journey, it’s this: make accessibility part of the process, not a checklist item. This principle applies whether you’re retrofitting an existing product or building something entirely new. Embedding accessibility checks into the CI/CD pipeline ensures issues are caught before they ever reach production, and shared ownership across teams keeps it from slipping off the radar. 
Of course, this integration takes an upfront investment in tools, training, and time. But the long-term payoffs are undeniable: fewer bugs, happier users, a better overall user experience, and full legal compliance. The goal is to make accessibility part of your daily routine, not something you just occasionally check up on. 
Communicating audit results effectively is a big part of sustaining that culture. Reports should be concise and use plain language. Even if it’s something purely technical, demonstrating how it creates an accessibility barrier will help everyone understand why it matters. That way, developers, designers, and clients, no matter their level of expertise, can see the problem clearly and know how to prioritize fixing it.
### After the audit: what comes next?
You’ve completed your first accessibility audit! Yay! Now you have a document that serves as a blueprint for resolving your app’s current issues and maintaining accessibility over time. This is the part when collaboration becomes essential. 
Designers may need to revisit color palettes, adjust spacing, and refine component behavior. Developers will implement code changes, clean up outdated patterns, and test alternative interactions to ensure compliance. QA teams will validate the changes and re-test using the same assistive technologies used during the audit, ensuring fixes truly work for end users.
A strong next step is establishing an accessibility roadmap: a clear, actionable plan for how and when you can make improvements. This roadmap should account for retesting after implementing fixes, ongoing monitoring, and scheduled formal audits. For live products, an annual audit is a solid baseline, with additional checks before any major release.
If you’re just starting your accessibility journey, the best approach is to begin with the basics. Study the relevant accessibility standards, explore available testing tools, and build awareness across the entire team. Start with an automated audit to get a sense of the most common issues, then dive into manual testing by learning to use screen readers – and really learn them. 
For projects already in progress, the best time to start is yesterday. I mean immediately. Begin with small, manageable improvements, such as proper labeling in development or selecting the right testing tools. From there, incorporate accessibility into every stage of the product lifecycle. Treat it as a non-negotiable standard rather than an optional extra. Once the team understands both how accessibility is done and why it matters, it naturally becomes part of the workflow.
If you’re wondering how often you should run an accessibility audit, it really depends on your product’s complexity and where you’re in the lifecycle. Accessibility testing should be part of everyday QA, built into each stage of development. Full, formal audits work best at bigger milestones, like wrapping up a project or prepping for a major release. You don’t need to do a full audit for every single feature, but regular accessibility checks should always be part of your testing flow. Once a product is live, aim for a standardized audit at least once a year, and definitely before redesigns, feature launches, bug fixes, or migrations. You’ll also want to schedule audits whenever new compliance rules come up or if users, clients, or major changes spark the need for a fresh look.
### Ready to take the next (necessary) step? 
Auditing an existing product for accessibility might feel like a huge lift, especially if accessibility wasn’t considered during initial development. But it’s absolutely doable and it’s worth doing, for your users, your business, and your team.
The real shift happens when accessibility stops being a fix and becomes part of your foundation. And the audit? That’s just the beginning of that transformation.
If you’re not sure where to start, start small. Run a scan. Pick one flow. Learn how your product feels when navigated with a keyboard or screen reader. You’ll quickly see the gaps and the opportunities.

Marketing Manager
With the automotive industry accelerating toward a digital future, Porsche Holding Salzburg is not just keeping pace – they’re redefining the rules. From revolutionizing customer portals to pioneering multi-brand design systems, they’re setting a new standard for innovation.
In a recent episode of our Digital Product TalksFlorian PankrazSebastian Busslehnercarlog
In this article, we dive into Porsche Holding's digital journey, spotlighting how they are shaping the future of mobility and how the company is tackling the complexities of a multi-brand environment.
### Porsche Holding Salzburg: Driving Automotive Innovation for Over 70 Years
Before we explore digital innovations, let's take a moment to understand Porsche Holding Salzburg's structure.
As one of the world’s largest automotive distributors, Porsche Holding Salzburg has been a leader in innovation for over seven decades. Often mistaken for the iconic sports car manufacturer Porsche AG, this Salzburg-based powerhouse operates as a distributor for Volkswagen Group brands – including Volkswagen, Audi, Škoda, and SEAT – across more than 20 countries.
As the automotive landscape continues to evolve, embracing digital tools and technologies becomes essential for staying competitive. Porsche Holding's commitment to innovation not only enhances operational efficiency but also enriches the customer experience. By leveraging data analytics and customer feedback, they can tailor services to meet individual needs, ensuring that every interaction is meaningful.
Porsche Holding stands out by combining scale with innovation, seamlessly harmonizing IT systems across wholesale and retail sectors. Yet, the company doesn’t just meet these challenges – it turns them into opportunities to innovate and redefine customer experiences.
### carlog: Porsche Holding's Digital Heart
At the core of Porsche Holding’s digital transformation lies carlog. In the podcast, carlog is described as their ""digital heart”, meaning it's much more than just a regular customer portal. The platform not only centralizes vehicle data – it also supports the entire lifecycle of a car, from purchase to long-term maintenance, creating a seamless and engaging user experience. By integrating various services into a single interface, carlog simplifies the user experience and fosters a stronger connection between the brand and its customers. 
As described by Sebastian Busslehner and Florian Pankraz, here’s what makes carlog a game-changer:
  1. Real-Time Access:
  2. Efficiency:
  3. Convenience: 
  4. Transparency:

carlog home screen
Sebastian Busslehner summarized carlog’s essence: 
The first car is sold by a salesperson. The second and third are sold by the after-sales department.
Carlog embodies this philosophy, fostering long-term relationships through user-friendly design and deep integration with back-end processes, such as real-time calendar synchronization with service centers.
### The Challenge: Tackling multi-brand Integration
One of the main topics in the podcast was the challenge of creating one digital system that works seamlessly across multiple brands and countries. The solution? A multi-brand design system that allows Porsche Holding to standardize processes while maintaining the individuality of each brand.
The Unity UX Design System 
Our goal is not just to develop a design system but to align the digital customer journey across our brands. 
This commitment ensures that every digital interaction, regardless of the brand, is intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly.
#### Unity’s Impact:
  * Consistency Across Brands
  * Brand-Specific Flexibility
  * Streamlined Development


Pankraz and Busslehner emphasized the importance of a cohesive design system in their work. In a multi-brand organization like Porsche Holding, maintaining a consistent user experience across different brands and models can be challenging. However, by implementing a reliable design system, the team ensures that all digital touchpoints aren’t only visually appealing but also intuitive and user-friendly.
Learn more about how to develop successful design systems in our blog article[ “How to Build a Design System”](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/how-to-build-a-design-system).
Unity design system
### ‍User Experience: Putting Customers First
Porsche Holding has long recognized the critical role of User Experience (UX) in its digital journey. Reflecting the company’s commitment to customer-centric design, Busslehner said:
We’ve fought hard to ensure that our organization prioritizes UX.
During the development of carlog, the team prioritized gathering extensive customer feedback. This collaborative approach ensured that every detail – from simplifying registration to streamlining vehicle management – was optimized for usability. Acting as ""translators"" between technical requirements and user needs, the team created a portal that feels effortless and intuitive. 
The results speak for themselves: Carlog has become one of Porsche Holding's most successful projects and an example of how customer-centric design can drive acceptance and loyalty. Find out more about carlog in our[ case study](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/projects/carlog).
### The Future of Dealerships: Digital, Hybrid, and Efficient
Porsche Holding envisions a future where dealerships blend the best of digital and physical experiences. This hybrid model acknowledges that while digitalization is key, physical touchpoints remain essential to the automotive journey.
Sebastian Busslehner explained: 
When you bring your car in for service today, you sign six paper documents. We want to change that. Customers should be able to shape their journey however it suits them best – digital, physical or a mix between both.
#### The vision:
  * Digital sales: 
  * Hybrid experiences:
  * Flexible:
  * Streamlined operations


The hybrid approach not only ensures business efficiency but also elevates customer satisfaction by offering choice and convenience. Digital tools such as carlog help streamline operations, allowing service advisors to spend more time nurturing customer relationships instead of dealing with admin tasks. Busslehner mentioned that the time saved can be used to build customer relationships, enjoy a coffee, and talk about their next car.
### Conclusion: Digitalization as a Strategy for Success
Through projects like carlog and the Unity UX Design System, Porsche Holding is redefining what it means to be a leader in automotive digitalization. 
By focusing on seamless brand integration and user experience, the company has established itself as a benchmark for innovation. As they continue to innovate and adapt, they are setting a standard for others to follow, proving that the future of the car industry is not just about vehicles, but about creating a holistic and enjoyable experience for every customer.
The future of the car industry is hybrid and digital, and with solutions like carlog, Porsche Holding is ready to make that vision a reality.

# Getting Started With Automated Testing
Ivan
Quality Assurance
Have you ever imagined someone else doing your job for you? Surely you did, I know I have. So, today I bring some good news — your dreams can become reality! But, to make those dreams come true, you will need some knowledge of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and a few tools, which I will talk about later. At COBE, we use Java, so before we start, I would suggest you get a book called Head First Java. Or if you are more of a visual type of person, like me, I would recommend a free course from Udemy. If you are already planning on giving up, please don’t. I will lead you through the whole setup of a project, and I am sure that at the end of this article you will be able to write your first automated test. So let’s go!
### Why you should start developing automated tests
Why are automated tests performed at all? With each change or new implementation in a project, we as QA engineers have to go through the entire application to determine if the changes or new features have caused unexpected defects on parts that have worked perfectly so far. This way we:
1. 
2. ‍
3.
Imagine a project that takes several years, and you have to go through parts of the application that you have already seen 1000 times over and over again every few days? It doesn’t sound fun at all to me, and to you? I don’t think so. 
In order to even begin the process of developing automated tests, you need to master the manual testing technique. I know, I wasn’t too happy about it either, but as soon as I realized that if I want to develop a quality automated test, I need to know everything about the application I’m working with. And the only way to achieve that is to test it manually first. Okay, now that you know whyhow
### How to create an automated test? 
#### Java
The first thing you need to install is Java
#### Environment
The next thing you need is an IDEIntelliJ
After a successful installation, it is necessary to create a new project. After clicking on Create new projectMavenFinish
#### Selenium
Selenium is a framework for [testing web applications](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services/app-design-agency). We will use it to retrieve the elements and finally choose what we want to do with those elements. Selenium .jar files can be easily added to our project using the pom.xmlpom.xml
Once you have added the dependency group for Selenium (which you can also find Shift + Command + Ipom.xml
#### TestNG
TestNG is a framework used in Java, and we will use it to validate tests. It needs to be added, like Selenium, through the pom.xml
#####  org.testng testng 7.1.0 test
Or you can find it 
####  WebDriver
The last thing we need before we start writing our code is WebDriver
##### safaridriver --enable
It is important to make sure that the versions of WebDriver you are downloading and your installed browser match! 
Once you’ve downloaded WebDriver, move it to an easily accessible location, as we’ll need its path when we start writing your first automated test.

### Your first automated test
Before you start writing your code, you need to open the IntelliJ IDEA Preferences and in the section Build, Execution, DeploymentCompilerJava CompilerTarget bytecode version
First step you need to do is create a class. We will create the class in the way shown in the image below:
You need to open the testjavaNewJava ClassEnter
Then you need to initialize WebDriver and set the URL of the page you want to open. In practice, it looks like this:
##### System.setProperty(""webdriver.chrome.driver"",""/Users/ihmelik/Desktop/chrome driver""); WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.get(""https://cobe.tech/"");
It is necessary to specify which WebDriver it is, and forward the path on which it is located. Using **driver.get()** , we retrieve the desired page. Now that you have enabled WebDriver and opened the website, you can start inspecting the elements you want to work with. Eg. If you have opened the BlogInspect
The element you are looking for is framed in the image, but it is also by nature highlighted so you know exactly what you are inspecting. In case of too little information, you can use the ChroPath addon through which you can get the xPath to your element. In practice, it would look something like this:
##### WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 15); wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath(""//a[cont ains(text(),'Blog')]""))).click();
Using this block of code, we found our element via xPath and ordered Selenium to click on the element. We also defined a time limit of 15 seconds in which the element must appear, otherwise the test fails because the required element was not found.
Why did we do that? 🤔 It’s just that sometimes pages take a little longer to load data, and even so we’ve avoided using the **Thread.sleep()** method, which forcibly pauses code execution. Otherwise you can search for elements through different things, but I will leave that to you to discover for yourself. In addition to the **click()** method, the second most commonly used method is **sendKeys()** , which, as the name suggests, allows you to send characters to a field.
### We’re almost there
Finally, to know if your test passed or failed, we will use the method from the TestNG framework. It works on the principle that you say what you expect, and then compare it to the actual value. As in our example, we want to check if we are really on the BlogDevelopmentBlogDevelopment**get.text()** method to retrieve it, which will look like this:
##### String expected = ""Development""; String actual = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath(""//a[cont ains(text(),'Development')]""))).getText(); Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected);
After running your first automated test, you will get a short printout in the console where you will be able to find out how many tests you have conducted, how many of them passed and how many failed. And that’s it. You did it! Great job!
‍
### Become a warrior of automated tests
So, how did you like everything you read so far? Did I encourage you to try automated testing yourself? And don’t worry, once you master the basics, you’ll be able to dig even deeper into the world of automated testing. Maybe we’ll meet there. 😄
If you’re still looking to find courage, I challenge you to write your first automated test using the guidelines I gave you. You can do a subscription test and check the functionality of **sendKeys()** method, but also explore new things yourself, as you will need a JavaScript method that will scroll to our NewsletteradoresNewsletter
A little encouragement for the end — I never saw myself writing an article for the public to see it, but it happened. So if you thought you would never develop automated tests, guess what? Now is the time. All you need is a little faith. 🍀
And hey, don’t be a stranger, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

# From E-Commerce to Mobility: Six App Reviews in Six Weeks
Katarina
Marketing Lead
Six app reviews in six weeks? Challenge completed! 
There are millions of apps out there — some are good, some brilliant, and others…well, they need a little help. Our passion for UX led us to select six apps across six different industries for a UX review, aiming to highlight both the strengths and areas for enhancement. To make it even more challenging, we limited each review to just six hours — what our designers found in that time, they reported on. 
The results were posted every Monday on our 
### About the Review Process 
We picked apps that significantly impact their industries or that our team personally uses and loves. For a well-rounded perspective, we intentionally chose apps from various industries to review, such as e-commerce, loyalty, and mobility, among others.
#### The review process included:
  1. Selection:
  2. Categories:
  3. Focus points:
  4. Insight sharing:


The reviews were conducted by senior UX/UI designers at COBE, with extensive experience across various industries. Each designer had six hours to review the app they chose within the predefined categories. To ensure the best possible review in a short amount of time, some of our designers worked together — after all, two heads are better than one.
#### Why We Took on This Challenge
The answer is simple: we think that there’s always room for improvement, even for the best apps. So, by doing these reviews, we hope to provide some useful insights into UX design, showcase best practices, and encourage innovation in app development. 
But, of course, as app users ourselves, we naturally want the best possible experience too. So, maybe we hope that brands take our feedback into account and make the necessary improvements.
### Which Apps Made the Cut?
As mentioned before, there's a big pool of apps to choose from, but these are the ones that we focused on. Don't worry — we're planning another session of reviews soon, so there will be plenty more to explore.
  1. Splitwise:
  2. Vinted:
  3. ARD Mediathek:
  4. OMR:
  5. DB Navigator:‍
  6. Payback:


### Deep Dive
#### Splitwise 
We kicked things off with Splitwise, a finance app designed to simplify splitting expenses with friends and family.
What we liked:
  * Easy account setup:
  * Effortless expense management:
  * Practical design:


Areas for improvement:
  * Navigation challenges:
  * Redundant information:‍
  * Limited engagement:


Overall, Splitwise offers a solid foundation but could stand out more by integrating with popular payment providers, simplifying navigation, and introducing more engaging design elements.
#### Vinted
Next, we reviewed Vinted, a popular app for buying and selling secondhand clothes. 
What we liked:
  * A simple and intuitive navigation:
  * Simple selling process:
  * Buyer protection:


Areas for improvement:
  * Lack of emotional touches:
  * Confusing filters and bookmarks:‍
  * Shipment-only option: 


In general, Vinted provides a secure and convenient experience with a simple interface. The core features are easy to figure out and use. However, the app could benefit from improvements in its architecture and search mechanisms, particularly in terms of accessibility and design quality.
#### ARD Mediathek
Moving on to the entertainment industry, we reviewed ARD Mediathek, a streaming app from one of Germany's major public broadcasters. It offers live TV, on-demand content, and a user-friendly interface for a comprehensive streaming experience. However, the latest mobile update has led to some performance issues for users, which we further explored.
What we liked:
  * Clear navigation: 
  * Smart search:
  * Accessibility settings: 


Areas for improvement:
  * Limited live streaming:
  * Accessibility: 
  * ​​Visual appeal:


Overall, ARD Mediathek provides a high range of quality content and features a user-friendly interface. The planned merger of ARD and ZDF technologies in 2025 is expected to address some current technical issues and streamline maintenance. There are significant opportunities for enhancing design and functionality, with a particular emphasis on inclusive content and design. By addressing the areas for improvement and focusing on these enhancements, ARD Mediathek could offer an even more engaging and accessible streaming experience.
#### OMR
The OMR Festival is one of the largest events for digital marketing and technology in the world. To help attendees get the most out of their experience, the festival has developed an app that allows them to create personalized watchlists of speakers, exhibitors, and much more. 
A dedicated conference app can be great for real-time updates, centralized information, and networking opportunities — when it's done right, of course. 
What we liked:
  * Event overview:
  * Bookmarking:
  * Consistent design:


Areas for improvement:
  * Map functionality:
  * Search option: ‍
  * Illustrations: 


The OMR app provides valuable tools for enhancing the festival experience with its personalized features and clear event organization. However, some improvements in navigation, search functionality, and design are needed to fully optimize user experience and accessibility.
#### DB Navigator
The DB Navigator app is widely used by those traveling with Deutsche Bahn, whether for business or pleasure. 
What we liked:
  * Simple ticket booking process:
  * Push notifications:


Areas for improvement:
  * Seat reservation process:
  * Multi-account support: ‍
  * Notifications: 


Overall, the app serves as a vital tool for enhancing the travel experience, although it could benefit from improvements in the seat reservation process, support for multiple accounts, and clearer notifications.
#### Payback
Last but not least, we explored the Payback app — a leading multi-partner loyalty platform where users can collect points, access exclusive offers, and earn rewards. Despite their strong presence in the loyalty app market, there are still some strategic enhancements that could elevate Payback even further. 
What we liked:
  * Coupon visibility:
  * Engaging features: 
  * Inclusive design:


Areas for improvement:
  * Search limitations: 
  * Translation issues:‍
  * Lack of keyword search:


Overall, Payback integrates offline and online shopping experiences, offering various interactive features. To enhance user experience and efficiency, the app could make some improvements in search functionality, translation consistency, and filtering options.
### Wrap-up
Through this six-week challenge, we’ve gained valuable insights into what makes an app excel in user experience. We hope our reviews inspire improvements and innovations in the apps we covered, and we look forward to sharing more UX adventures with you in the future. 
Let us know if you have any questions, we’re here for you.

# How a Successful Remote Onboarding Works
Julia
Project Management
After more than a year of on-off lockdown, remote work has become a familiar term. From one day to the next, one's home has become a workplace, and even the colleagues can only be seen on the screen day in and day out. This also creates challenges for training new employees.
When the world changes abruptly and hardly a stone (or pixel) remains on the other, you can no longer enjoy the (alpine-)view from the office, there is no delicious coffee or fresh fruit basket – what differentiates one company from the other? What keeps it together??
One thing is that you suddenly see your colleagues on a computer screen only. After all, the shared experiences of the last Christmas party or the last birthday in the office are still vivid in everyone's mind. So there's no shortage of things to talk about remotely. And yet something is missing, even if you keep each other up to date between two online appointments. There's no virtual substitute for a casual chat at the coffee machine, a shared lunch, or an after-work beer.
But it's a different story if you only join the new team when you're working remotely. Is it still possible to settle into the new environment without the chance of these brief but important conversations in the coffee kitchen or the shared memories of the last company event?
Several times, we asked ourselves at COBE: What is it like to start a new job remotely? Now, after almost two years of on-off lockdown, we not only have some wonderful new colleagues on board, but are also taking the next step – with seven full-time remotes who join their project teams every day from Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Berlin. We asked them and summarized the most important things:
### Collaboration is Key
First things first: The work itself must also function smoothly remotely – starting with the exchange within the team as well as with clients, through the development of new designs to workshops. So it shouldn't make a difference whether you're standing at a white board with your colleagues or sitting at home using tools like[Miro](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/how-to-turn-research-insights-into-frameworks-digitally).
With the right tools, working remotely can work just as well as in the office. This is where COBE, as well as the entire team, is called upon to find and provide the right tools to make collaboration as easy as possible for everyone.
What sounds simple in theory often turns out to be a challenge in practice, because there is no single solution for smooth remote collaboration. Rather, it helps to take an individual look at the team and its members: How is the joint work in the digital project space? How do they communicate? What are the requirements and expectations of the tools?
**Our tip: Digital work requires the right tools. However, these must be individually tailored to the team.**
Whether on- or offline, the right tools are important.
### Never (have to) work alone
All the tools are ready, you could actually start right away – but how do you learn to work correctly with each other? The inhibition threshold to simply call someone you don't know well is higher than to briefly stop by the next room.
There are various ways to create a pleasant working atmosphere. The following have proven successful for us:
‍
  1. Chief Happiness Officer


The focus is on people – from the very first contact. That's why we have our Chief Happiness Officer Dominik at COBE. As a safe haven, he is the point of reference for everyone – the glue that holds us together at COBE. He is the first face a newbie meets in his application process, and from then on always the go-to person for any topic.
‍
  1. Mentoring


No one knows the stumbling blocks of the first days, the pitfalls of the tools, and the various idiosyncrasies of colleagues better than someone who has experienced it firsthand. Especially in the beginning, there are naturally many questions. A regular exchange with your personal mentor can be enormously helpful. For this reason, every newbie at COBE is assigned a permanent mentor who accompanies them through the first few months. For new employees like Adrian, this was advantageous: “The weekly feedback meeting with the mentor lets me know where I stand at all times and gives me the opportunity to raise my own issues.”
‍
  1. Team-Up


Only teamwork makes the dream work – true to this motto, we make sure that every newbie becomes part of a permanent project team in his or her first week. Ideally, mentor and mentee are in the same project team. “I felt comfortable right from the start”, Luis tells us, “that was simply due to the super open team, which always has an open ear and offers help.” So the key to a dream team is a pleasant communication culture. 
**Our tip: A Chief Happiness Officer, consistent mentoring, and a good team-up create optimal conditions for good teamwork.**
Chief Happiness Officer Dominik is onboarding a newbie.
### Talk to me
So far, so good: Hardware & software are set up, team and mentor are ready to go. Then nothing more should go wrong, right? Even though these are the basic building blocks, the success of remote onboarding depends on other factors.
In the office, you pop your head through the door, but the question “Do you have 5 minutes?” is much less likely to be asked remotely. Communication is delayed, you can't see if the other person is busy. As a result, people are more reluctant to approach each other. In Adrian's opinion, there's just something different about sitting in a room together and looking each other in the eye than just seeing each other through a screen. “Plus, remotely, you can never be sure if you might just pull a team member off task with your question.”
Exactly here lies the problem, because only those who speak can be helped. A permanent contact person, a mentor and the necessary tools do support communication – but only to a certain extent, because the crucial thing is a good communication culture that is promoted and, above all, lived.
> ""We talk a lot and, if necessary, repeatedly about topics and so, as a newcomer, you really don't need to have any fear of contact or the feeling of disturbing someone in their work."" - Adrian
It is important that this dialogue takes place from the very beginning. Especially for the remotees, common formats are important to get into conversation with colleagues away from the work talk. Accordingly, the onboarding formats must be organized in such a way that a dialog is already created here, which is then continually expanded over the following weeks
**Our tip: A good communication culture ensures successful onboarding.**
### Closeness despite distance
Even if they are not physically present, colleagues also like to join gatherings online.
Keyword “joint formats” – how can that work between Berlin and Munich, Frankfurt and Salzburg?
Here, it's worth taking a look at what shared activities already existed before Corona: for example, digital game nights or coffee dates in randomly assembled groups can bring the office feeling into your own four walls – as best they can.
> ""What I find difficult about remote work is, that the social aspect is different. It's worth so much to sit down with colleagues in the office for an after-work beer or two, have lunch together, or even just a quick coffee. But through our culture touchpoints, which also take place remotely, you have a good exchange and feel integrated quickly."" - Isabella
To achieve this, new online formats have to be developed to replace the former offline events. At COBE, there is a permanent team that takes care of this in addition to Brand & Culture. Definitely a plus for Marcus: “Christmas/birthday gifts, poems and many other small details bring everyone closer together even in such times and make a good working atmosphere!”
So, in the past two years, we've added a few new team formats that are specifically designed to keep us close despite physical distance. They even have the opposite effect: we sometimes get to know each other even better!
**Our tip: Every company is different – what helps is regular exchange with each other.**
### Making Memories
Even the best remote set-up reaches its limits somewhere. Because there's one thing no tool or digital event can replace: personal, physical contact. Spending workdays together in a project room, enjoying a break in the sun at lunchtime and toasting with an after-work beer in the evening have a completely different social aspect. For this reason, it makes sense (depending on the current situation) to establish an “onsite time” – i.e. presence times in the office – as part of onboarding. Here, the newbie can get to know the office and the vibe in the first few weeks, as well as build a personal relationship with his or her new colleagues.
> “I was fortunately in the office for the first few weeks, but had many onboarding sessions remotely. I felt super welcome and would say the difference from a non-remote start has been minimal."" - Luis
Being onsite doesn't just make it easier to get started. It reduces inhibitions that might arise from working remotely later on. This acclimation period is the perfect opportunity to arrive at a new company and its culture.
**Our tip: Face-to-face periods during onboarding make the acclimation period easier.**
### Conclusion: Culture beats anything
Regular get-togethers after work are a natural part of our office life.
A good company culture is not demonstrated by the beautiful view from the office, the free coffee or the debauched parties – even though these benefits are certainly not bad. It's the people who make up a company and the communication culture that is cultivated and, above all, lived there. So if you take what works well in the office, transfer it to the remote world, and add the necessary team spirit, remote working becomes not a duty but a pleasure.
**Our checklist for successful remote onboarding:**
  1. the right tool set-up
  2. solid mentoring
  3. a pleasant communication culture
  4. constant exchange
  5. create rituals

# From a One-Woman-Band to a Whole Team: Meet Our Designers
Vanesa
UX/UI Designer
When you're a UX/UI Designer, no two days are alike. With all the research, communication with both clients and internal teams, prototyping, usability testing, and ongoing education you can never really get bored. But, what's it like to be a UX/UI Designer at COBE, you might wonder? We asked Monika – our UX/UI design team lead in the Osijek office. When she joined COBE (almost) five years ago, she set the ground for the design team in Osijek. Now she's leading a team of 10 people. A lot can change in just a matter of years, don't you agree?
Monika, welcome to our first interview of this kind! Let's start by introducing yourself to the world. I find your career path quite interesting – 
  * When I first graduated in computer science, I did both frontend and design at a small agency in Osijek. As luck would have it, it's where I met our current HR Manager. Soon after he left, I decided to join COBE as well, but as a UX/UI Designer. I didn't know what to expect, but I was ready for a change. So I packed my things, and here I am. 


Looking back at the five years you've been here and all the projects you've worked on, if you had to pick a favorite, which one would it be?
  * My favorite and simultaneously the first ""big"" project I’ve worked on, was a travel planning app. Since I'm a travel enthusiast, the app was so interesting for me – I was working and planning my next destination at the same time. The project, unfortunately, stopped when the pandemic began. But in general, I’d say I enjoy working on bigger, long-term projects.


Is there anything you find challenging at your job? 
  * Designing features from scratch! That’s the real challenge because there’s nothing to rely on. Other than that, I’d say pitch presentations can be scary – I mean, you’re competing with other agencies, and as much as you’re prepared, somehow you always wonder if it’s enough. 


Switching between projects and different client requests asks for a lot of creativity and innovation. Where do you find inspiration? Do you follow current design trends?
  * I find the most inspiration in existing, similar products, but I also use sites like Dribbble, Pinterest, and Behance – they have the good stuff. They’re also great for keeping up with new design trends, especially with the upcoming topic of Metaverse. 


Your journey in COBE started almost five years ago, and you were the first designer in the Osijek office. What about the rest of your team – what's their story? 
  * Well, Dražen joined the team first, back in 2018 when he was still a student. He's now a senior, just like Matea, who came right after him. Later on, came our illustration master – Darija. And then Petar joined. His story is quite interesting actually - he's a digital marketing expert who decided to switch careers and commit to UX/UI design. Ivana and Elena both started their careers as students and are now full-time employees. We also have three talented students on board – Alen, Ena, and Ilija. All ten of us take on different roles in both our team and in the project teams. And in case two designers work on the same project, the senior one takes on the role of the Project Design Lead.


Other than design, I’d say a big part of your job is communication – with your project team, clients, and the design team in Munich. Why is communication important in what you do? 
  * Well, for example, we have weekly meetings with our clients to give them insights into what’s happening on the project at any time. That way, we avoid misunderstandings and “negative” feedback. Also, we’re always in touch with our fellow designers in Munich. Once a month, we have a design jour fixe, where all our designers get together. When I first joined COBE, I spent a few weeks with them in Munich, working and learning, so I enjoy it when an opportunity presents itself that we work together on a project. Two design teams are always better than one, especially when they’re in two cool locations so we can visit each other. Besides designers, we work very closely with developers too. I know there’s a rumor out there that developers and designers have tensions working together, but honestly, I enjoy working with our developers. 


Meetings in person vs. meetings online –
  * Well, for starters, we don't have to visit Munich for every project kickoff, which saves us a bit of time. Plus, most online meetings show up to be just as effective as the in-person ones.In the beginning, we thought there was no way to do workshops with clients virtually, but as soon as we discovered MIRO, everything changed, for the better. Figma also became a big part of our daily communication, both with clients and the team. It turned out to be the perfect tool for delivering designs to clients, creating simple prototypes, and for hands-off design development. 


And what about your design team in Osijek? Do you have online meet-ups, or do you sit together once in a while? 
  * We have an internal event called Design Weekly that’s been running for over two years now. We do it either online, or in person, depending on what suits the team best. It’s where we discuss all design topics, share tips and tricks for Figma (and other tools) but also touch on the topic of problems and how to solve them. Other than that we have design reviews once in two weeks and beer after work, whenever we can. 


Obviously, you guys love to learn from each other, but taking courses and visiting conferences are also important for your growth. Is there a course or a conference you attended that you would like to highlight as your favorite? Or is there something you would like to educate yourself more about?
  * Digital Labin, the largest UX/UI conference in Croatia will forever have our hearts. Last year, we also participated in a two-day Design Thinking workshop which was really fun. We’re also very proud of our two NN/g certificates, of course. Honestly, the team is always learning – we just finished a few design courses, and last week we ended our leadership training too. Besides taking courses and visiting conferences, sometimes we speak at them too. The perfect example is Darija, who held her first lecture at last year's KulenDayz, an annual IT design conference in Osijek. And the next thing I want to educate myself more on is the product life cycle.


Okay, you showed us you love to learn, but can you party? What's keeping your team spirits high? Besides beer, we know you all like that.
  * I believe the dynamic of the group is so good because we have a similar set of values – we're open-minded, determined, responsible and we try to be modest in everything we do. And of course, we can party! We hang out once in a while, play board games, Playstation, and have rap battles. I know I just said we’re modest but I want everyone to know that I’m the rap queen of the group. *Mic drop*


We can’t wait for the next team building to see those rap battle skills! Besides being open-minded and responsible, are there any other soft skills you find helpful in your everyday work? What skills are important to have as a UX/UI Designer?
  * I think resourcefulness is a useful skill for every designer – meaning one can cope with any situation. If you're highly self-aware, it will be easier to accept any kind of feedback. Empathy too, even though this is important for every profession, not just designers.


There are 10 designers on your team right now – would you like to expand it? What are your plans for the future?
  * I don’t see an expansion in the near future as we have just hired two new students. But, when we decide it’s time, we’d like another senior designer to join our team. Maybe someone with experience in a different field, to get new perspectives. And let's not forget about a UX researcher – currently, only our Munich team designers do UX research, and I'd love to have one person here in Osijek too, to be in charge of that. But this is a topic for the future. 


As we reach the end of this interview, I look back at all the achievements Monika and her team had over the years and I must admit – I’m quite impressed. We love to see a team that learns and grows together but also keeps each other grounded. 
If you have any questions for our designers, make sure to contact us. And if design is not your thing

# How to Conduct Usability Tests Digitally
Julia
UX Researcher
From the Series “Managing your UX Research Remotely”. This is the third article in our series, which is concerned with the transforming of UX Research workflows into digital processes. After explaining why and how we work with Dovetail and Miro in the first two articles*, this article is all about how to turn research insights into frameworks such as personas, when working in a completely digital and remote setup.
## What we needed
Even though Miro helped us a lot for managing the synthesis phase and conducting interviews, it couldn’t help us with usability tests.Of course, it is probably somehow possible to integrate prototypes in Miro and have participants use them. However, Miro is not best suited to display click events, especially because in usability tests, the scenarios should be as realistic as possible. That means that a usability test for an app should be conducted with a smartphone to have the same features and possibilities but also the same disadvantages and restrictions a user would experience in real life situations.
Therefore, usability tests are usually set up in an environment where you have a specific test device on which the software is tested — a laptop, a smartphone, or even some specific product with a user interface if we’re talking about embedded software — and the participants are given some common tasks to perform with the device.
Meanwhile, the researcher takes a close look at how participants interact with these prototypes and where they experience problems. To do so, it is not only relevant to observe which elements participants (try to) click, or how they navigate through the product. It’s also important to see how participants react and what their facial expressions look like. This gives researchers additional information about how participants are experiencing a product. In a physical usability testing setup, in which we sit right next to the participants, these additional information are quite easy to catch. For a remote situation, however, this means you do not only have to be able to see the screen of the prototype the participants are interacting with but also their faces.
## Meet Lookback
This is where lookback (
A great benefit of Lookback is that additional observers can join the interview, but won’t be able to speak with the participants, and the participants won’t notice them at all. That means that multiple observers are able to join a usability testing without distracting or intimidating the participants. As an interviewer, you get a shared view where you see both the prototype and the participants’ interactions with it, as well as their faces and reactions. Moreover, you can communicate with other observers in the integrated chat area, or leave time-stamped notes for each other.
Participants only see the interviewer at the beginning of the interview. Once the interaction with the prototype is started, participants only see the prototype and can use it without any distractions. For mobile scenarios, Lookback comes with an App (called Participate
## Our concluding thoughts on Lookback
Lookback is a super cool tool, and the great thing about it is that it fully focusses on being a user research tool, so the usability is well-thought-out. With all its benefits, the tool works so well that we also use it when conducting usability tests in person, because it allows us to include other observers and to produce recordings of the prototype interactions and the facial expressions of participants.
However, there are also some disadvantages, especially when it comes to mobile testing: Participants need to be technically experienced to set up the app correctly. Also, we experienced some major issues related to internet connection quality, since the app seems to require an even stronger internet connection than normal video calls. However, in total, the benefits of Lookback outweigh the disadvantages, and we will definitely continue using the tool after COVID.

## Our final conclusion
So, as this article series is coming to an end, it’s time to draw a conclusion on what the COVID situation has taught us about remote [UX Research](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services/ux-research-agency).
All in all, Corona put us in a place where we needed to re-think a lot of our work and processes. And even though Corona itself obviously isn’t something to be thankful for, I am thankful for the change that came with it — or to be even more precise — for the speed in which we were able to achieve this change. I’m sure that sooner or later we would have thought of ways to improve or enhance our working process, either because we were confronted with situations in which we would have needed solutions like that even without COVID, or just because we at COBE think of ourselves and our working processes as a constant beta setup and always look for ways to improve ourselves.
However, the situation that we and everyone else are currently facing has accelerated this process of improvement a lot and I’m very thankful for the things we’ve learned along the way. I’m curious to see how the tools we now use will develop and how we will further integrate their various features — and I’m also sure that the next tool is just around the corner waiting for us to discover the many opportunities it has to offer.

# How to Encrypt Data on Android With Jetpack Security
Damir
Android Development
We are all aware that it’s important to store data securely inside an app. With the Android Jetpack Security library, this is easier than ever. In just a few lines of code, you can set up the data encryption and decryption system. Additionally, we are going to cover the usage of BiometricPrompt as an extra level of security, using time-bound keys. 
Unlike iOS, where it’s possible to store your password, PIN, certificates, etc. directly in 
  1. First, you generate the cryptographic key which you store into the Android Keystore system
  2. Then you use that key to encrypt and decrypt data


Okay, let’s get started.
### Jetpack Security
Jetpack Security (JetSec) is a part of Android Jetpack. It provides abstractions for encrypting and decrypting SharedPreferencesFiles
To use JetSec in our application you need to include it in your project first. Add this to your app-modulebuild.gradle
##### implementation(""androidx.security:security-crypto:1.1.0-alpha03"")
You must also add the Google Maven
### Key management
‍MasterKeyMasterkey
“ lets you store cryptographic keys in a container to make it more difficult to extract from the device. Once keys are in the keystore, they can be used for cryptographic operations with the key material remaining non-exportable.”
To generate the key with default parameters, try doing this: 
##### MasterKey.Builder(this).setKeyScheme(MasterKey.KeyScheme.AES256_GCM).build()
If you chose **AES256_GCM** KeyScheme
##### KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder( mKeyAlias, KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT | KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT) .setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_GCM) .setEncryptionPaddings(KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_NONE) .setKeySize(DEFAULT_AES_GCM_MASTER_KEY_SIZE)
If you need to further configure your key, you can use KeyGenParameterSpec
Let me introduce you to two additional options for increasing key security:
  1. Allow the key to be stored on a separate hardware module – this will improve security, but unfortunately, it comes with a performance drawback. Also, please note that you can apply it only to devices running API 28, or higher. And don't forget to set setRequestStrongBoxBacked
  2. Restrict key usage until the user authenticates via biometrics. Set setUserAuthenticationRequired


If you choose to increase the security of your application with user authentication, learn how to do it below. 
### Biometric prompt
After you set the option setUserAuthenticationRequired BiometricPromptfeature/biometrics
Now, place the function that requires the key (in our example, that’s the lambda function onSuccess()) inside of the AuthenticationCallbackonAuthenticationSucceeded
##### BiometricPrompt(this, executor, object : BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback() { override fun onAuthenticationSucceeded(result: BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult) { super.onAuthenticationSucceeded(result) onSuccess() } })
And change the key generation to:
##### MasterKey.Builder(this).apply { setKeyScheme(MasterKey.KeyScheme.AES256_GCM) setUserAuthenticationRequired(true, 10) }.build()
The second parameter in setUserAuthenticationRequired
In case your user doesn’t authenticate, and you try to use the key, this will be the outcome:
##### android.security.keystore.UserNotAuthenticatedException: User not authenticated
### Encrypt files
Now, let’s finally get to data encrypting and decrypting. First, you need to create an EncryptedFile
##### private val encryptedFile = EncryptedFile.Builder( App.instance, File(App.instance.filesDir, FILE_NAME), masterKey, EncryptedFile.FileEncryptionScheme.AES256_GCM_HKDF_4KB ).build()
To write into the file, use openFileOutput
##### encryptedFile.openFileOutput().apply { write(password.toByteArray(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) flush() close() }
Using the Device File Explorer, you can explore the file content and check if the encryption was successful. The path should look something like this: data/data/projectName/files/FILE_NAME.
To read from the encrypted file, use the following:
##### fun getPassword(): String { var password = EMPTY_STRING try { val bufferReader = encryptedFile.openFileInput().bufferedReader() password = bufferReader.readText() bufferReader.close() } catch (exception: IOException) { Log.d(LOG_EXCEPTION_TAG, exception.message ?: """") } return password }
In case the file doesn’t exist, you will get an exception
### Encrypt SharedPreferences
If you need to store smaller data securely, you can use EncryptedSharedPreferences
Using EncryptedSharedPreferencesEncryptedSharedPreferences,SharedPreferences
To create EncryptedSharedPreferences, 
##### private val encryptedSharedPreferences: SharedPreferences = EncryptedSharedPreferences.create( App.instance, SHARED_PREFS_FILENAME, masterKey, EncryptedSharedPreferences.PrefKeyEncryptionScheme.AES256_SIV, EncryptedSharedPreferences.PrefValueEncryptionScheme.AES256_GCM )
As you can see, EncryptedSharedPreferences.create()SharedPreferencesEditor
##### fun savePassword(password: String) { encryptedSharedPreferences.edit().putString(PASSWORD_KEY, password).apply() }
##### fun getPassword(): String { return encryptedSharedPreferences.getString(PASSWORD_KEY, EMPTY_STRING) ?: EMPTY_STRING }
If you check the XML file, from the SharedPreferences,
##### AUbjoL+JzndtuR5ijEgscWBN1Juy4wXRG5vm4DmNPB44jHbuu5ut+WbjUjsgNEoP9cw=
### Wrap-up & more resources
The sample app covers encrypting and decrypting data with EncryptedFile EncryptedSharedPreferencesMasterKey feature/biometricsBiometricPrompt
Android is safe enough, but sometimes you want to use an extra level of security for the sensitive data like passwords, API keys or whatever you define as sensitive in your app.
Jetpack security provides out-of-the-box security for general purposes, but also allows you to customize and enhance your security, if needed, with adding StrongBox

# How to Explain a Technical Subject to a Non-Technical Audience
Damir
Backend Developer
Knowing how to use your knowledge to solve a problem is one thing, but understanding how to teach someone else something you understand completely is a whole other set of skills – especially when they don’t know a thing about it.
In this article, I’ll introduce you to the methods I have found useful when explaining technically challenging topics to people with no strong or no technical background at all. We’ll kick the article off with why this skill is important for you and how it’ll help you grow as a communicator. Whether you’re a developer, project manager, or marketing specialist, I firmly believe that you'll get some use out of this article.
*Please keep in mind that the techniques I'm about to share with you are based on my personal experiences and may not be entirely applicable to your situation. Teaching and communication have a lot more layers than what I'll cover in this article.
### Why is it important for me to know this? 
If you work in tech, I’m sure you participate in meetings where you need to explain how something works on your platform, whether it’s mobile, backend, frontend, etc. What happens when other meeting participants don’t understand what you’re trying to explain? Be honest here – do you feel like giving up? Sure, that would be the easiest option, but don’t call it a day just yet. Believe it or not, there is a way around it. Just incorporate the following methods into your next meeting and see how it goes. To steer clear of misunderstandings, before you start explaining anything, make sure you yourself fully understand the topic. 
### Know your audience, but don’t assume anything 
Before kicking off the meeting, always check with other attendees if they have any prior experience or knowledge about the topic you’re going to discuss. This will help you get a feel of where the conversation could go and whether it might get too technical for them. If it’s someone you’ve worked with before, you’ll most likely already have an insight into their level of knowledge. What’s important to note here is that you should never assume someone’s familiarity with a topic
### Develop stories and compare them with life scenarios
If you're going to discuss a tech-heavy topic in the meeting and you anticipate that it might be challenging for a non-technical audience to grasp, you can spice things up by incorporating real-life examples into the conversation. Try to think of a relatable situation that can help bridge the gap and make it easier for them to understand. Or you can just go ahead with my example. 😀
This is the story I use when explaining tokens, cookies, authorization, and authentication to my fellow colleagues:
Imagine you’re headed to visit your lawyer for the first time. To set foot in his office, first, you need to enter his office building. At the entrance, you’re greeted by the receptionist who asks about your credentials. Sometimes it’s enough to leave your last name, but other times you’ll need to hand over your ID. This is when the receptionist checks the system to see if you have a scheduled appointment with the lawyer and the “right” to access the building. Now, this would be the equivalent of you trying to sign in to a website where the server usually asks you for your username and password, a.k.a. your authentication. Once the receptionist confirms your meeting and makes sure your identification documents are valid, you’ll get an accreditation that states you’re a visitor/client/something else which opens the doors to certain parts of the building. For example, as a visitor, you can only access the lobby and the restroom, while as a client, you can meet with the lawyer as well. This is equal to getting a token or a cookie from a website, which you’ll unknowingly use to access certain parts of the website  the authorization. The administrator can access even higher levels of security parts of the app. Last but not least, the accreditation you get from the receptionist usually lasts a certain amount of time – an hour, a day, or a week. It’s the same with tokens and cookies that last for a while until you need to authenticate again. 
This story not only helps you understand the key distinctions between authorization and authentication but also provides a glimpse into the world of tokens and cookies. You can always try explaining it as it is, but if you know that a topic might be hard to understand, you can use an example situation that would make it easier to follow. 
### Use visual aid when needed
Sometimes, a visual demonstration communicates an idea more effectively than relying solely on verbal explanations. So don’t be afraid to put your drawing skills to use, whether you have them or not – doodle something, make a graph, or find a useful image. People are visual beings, more likely to recall what they saw than what they heard. Not only will this help a person with understanding the issue itself, but it will also connect the issue and the explanation with a visual representation. 
Also, let me introduce you to something called The picture superiority effect human memory is extremely sensitive to the symbolic modality of presentation of event information.
### Feel the room
This goes for everything in life, but it’s especially important in the context we’re talking about. During a conversation or a meeting, people often give verbal and nonverbal signals that can serve as feedback. This will usually indicate if you need to slow down, simplify something, or repeat yourself, so whoever you’re explaining it to feels less confused. To find out how they’re feeling, you can always incorporate these questions into your meeting: Everything clear so far? Are you following me, or do I need to slow down?
Most people will give you an honest answer if you ask them directly and it will help you keep track of whether they’re following you or not. This is, of course, just general advice: you should adjust your actions to your audience’s reactions and signals. 
### Use humor and keep it simple
What’s a better way to ease up a heavy topic than with a splash of humor? To break the ice, in some meetings I’d use a line like: I know this isn’t the most interesting topic, so if some of you fall asleep, I won’t judge you, but I’ll wake you up, 
### Give hard topics a context and a bigger picture
Sometimes it’s easier to comprehend how something works by demonstrating how it fits a bigger picture and by putting it into context. Here’s an example:
Imagine you’re talking to a Project manager, trying to explain why the code can’t be live at the exact same moment you finish developing. Let’s say you’re using GitHub for versioning – this means you’ll have to explain what’s a pull request and get someone to approve your code. To you, this is an easy concept to understand because you’ve done it so many times. But to a Project manager, for example, it might not be clear why it’s essential to have another pair of eyes to check the code. If that’s the case, I suggest you use a different approach and explain the bigger picture; talk about what’s a pipeline, why you’re doing PR in the first place, walk them through the topic of commits and pushes and lastly, explain the importance of a PR. 
This is just one of the examples I use at work, which proves to be very successful. By giving a phrase a context, you also give it purpose, and that way, half of the explaining is usually done.
### ‍Be realistic with yourself
It’s important to stay rational when creating expectations about teaching someone a certain topic. To be fair, some topics need vast background knowledge to even understand the subject. ‍
To summarize, these are the most important messages to follow from this blog post:
  * Know your audience and their level of understanding, but don’t assume
  * Create stories and compare them with real-life scenarios
  * Use visual aid when needed
  * Feel the room
  * Use humor and keep it simple
  * Give complex topics a context
  * Set realistic expectations


That’s a wrap! Let me know if you find this article useful and if you’d like to hear more suggestions like this. 🙂

# How to Introduce the QA Process Into an Agile Team
Nikolina
QA Lead
If you work in an agile environment, you’re aware that every software life cycle includes testing as a big part of it. The way you introduce testing to development phases of a project is called a process. Or more specifically, a QA process. 
Imagine the following situation: A new project just kicked off and the client requests a Quality assurance engineer on the team. Neither he nor his development team have ever worked with a QA before, so reasonably, many questions appear – both from the team and the client. And guess what? You, as the QA engineer who’s joining the team, will have to answer them:
  * How do we work from now on? Will QA block my progress and what happens with our velocity; does QA slow us down?
  * What’s with all the bug tickets, do I really have to fix them? 
  * Why should I let someone else test the app? I was doing just fine without them. 


‍
Got it? Good, now let’s move on to developing the QA process.
### Creating the QA process
#### 1. Introduce the Quality Assurance role to the project team 
Your first step is to explain the QA engineer’s responsibilities and how he/she will contribute to the project. This is when you’ll have to make it clear that the role of a QA engineer is to help improve the process, stories, requirements and most importantly, the quality of the mobile or web application. Important notice: developers will still be very much involved in testing the app’s quality. ‍
a) To support these arguments, first you have to have the knowledge – that means learning everything you need to know about testing principles, levels, and types of testing. Without mastering the basics, you won’t be able to educate others about what you do and prove the importance of your work. In the end, it could make it harder to introduce the QA process to the team – and this is something we want to avoid. 
b) Secondly, you want to get involved in all team activities, as much as possible, and right from the start. That means participating in all scrum meetings, from the beginning until the end. I have to warn you – in the beginning, there will probably be situations when the team doesn’t invite you to certain meetings. Don’t let this discourage you. Stay persistent, ask questions, and offer solutions – soon, they’ll see all the wonderful benefits of having you on the team. 
#### 2. Get to know the project team
If you’re familiar with the agile methodology, you know that every team has its own dynamic and approach to work. And the key to success? You know it already, it’s adaptation. 
From what I’ve gathered over the years, there are no general rules of getting familiar with your team – it all depends on your teammates. New project usually means a new team, so every time you start a project, you’ll probably have to come up with a fresh set of rules to define the type of the relationship you want to have with them. My advice is to always go with a friendly approach – it was proven to give the best results, at least in my case. This means building a relationship with the developers where you can openly tell them you found a bug and they’ll react positively to it. It also means reaching a level of comfort with the Product owners that allows you to openly discuss any issues and improvements. The Product owner should be your best friend on the project and believe in your approach – if you, for example, say it’s time for a release, they should trust your decision. The same goes with the designers. I always include them in the implementation part of the project and if I see that some part of the design doesn’t make sense, I’ll challenge them. Don’t be afraid to speak up, it’s all part of the job. But as I said, always do it in a friendly way.
When it comes to the team dynamics, it’s also important to recognize the velocity of your team. This will affect the QA process you’re trying to build with them, but also, the number of releases you have. For example, if your team works fast, it makes complete sense to have everyday releases. If not, once a week might be just enough. 
#### 3. Start reporting!
Every bug you report, you need to document in the tracking tool you’re using on the project, for multiple reasons: 
  * You don’t want to lose any bugs,
  * You want to know the status of every bug, 
  * You want a visible trace of your work; I like to call this no bugs under the table


Until the team resolves all bugs, I suggest keeping the stories open. If resolving all of them is not a possibility, make sure at least all the major and critical ones are resolved. To help developers know what’s a priority, use prioritization. [Here’s](https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/prioritization-in-quality-assurance-how-we-do-it-4de803167184) how we do it at COBE. 
Another important thing is to adapt the tracking tool you’re using to the project. When you open the tracking tool, you should be able to see what’s ready for testing right away. So feel free to add an additional column or a simple label that will tell you when something’s done. Occasionally, a developer might say that something’s done because it works on their computer.
Keep in mind that until they’ve made a build with the included feature, something can’t be considered done.
#### 4. Release
Since you, as a QA Engineer, are the person who’s testing the app the most, let’s face it: you’re the person who knows when it’s the right time to release it. That’s why you should be the one in charge of releases. If this doesn’t work for your team, for any reason whatsoever, try not to fight about it. Just make sure that you disclaim any blame if a release doesn’t go well. Remember, you can’t control something that you’re not responsible for. 
### What now?
Last thing: just start! At COBE, we like to say: Better done than perfect

# How to Perform Load Testing Using JMeter
Amela
QA Engineer
Tickets to your favorite singer's show go on sale in half an hour. You've been waiting at your laptop since morning, your fingers are sweating, and you've already memorized your card number by heart. As the minutes tick by, the moment finally arrives. But when you try to buy the tickets, a bold ""500"" error message appears on your screen. How can this happen when the app is supposed to handle high traffic and provide service to all users at any given moment? The creators of this app knew it needed to be designed to handle large volumes of simultaneous requests, but it still failed. 
How can this be prevented in the future? Is there a way to test applications for such high demand? Can we simulate thousands of users accessing the app at once during testing? Luckily, the answer is yes.
### Introduction to load testing 
Applications undergo extensive testing during development. However, testing manually or automatically usually shows how the app works for a single user, not how it would perform with many users using it at the same time. To test this, it's necessary to simulate multiple users making requests simultaneously. This helps identify if the server can handle the load or if there are issues with processing requests and providing proper responses.
To make sure applications perform well in real-life conditions, you can conduct various types of performance tests. If you want to know how much load an app can endure, the answer lies in load testing
Load testing is a type of performance testing that measures how an application performs under heavy user activity and various conditions. It applies to all kinds of applications, whether mobile or web and covers both frontend and backend. Through load testing, a Quality assurance engineer assesses how many users can use the app simultaneously without encountering any issues.
You might ask yourself if load testing will give you a magic number of users that an application can handle. Well, the answer is no. Analyzing load testing results isn't as simple as labeling them as expected or not. There are various factors that must be considered to determine the app's capacity, and even then, the answer won't be a single, definite number.
### Starting with Apache JMeter
Before conducting load testing, you need to make a few decisions. The first is selecting the tool you'll use. Personally, I recommend Apache JMeteran open-source software
JMeter offers an intuitive GUI for writing and debugging tests. However, when actually running tests, it's recommended to use CLI mode (Command-line mode) for better resource handling and more accurate results. All run results will be generated as CSV or XML files, and JMeter also generates an HTML report containing all necessary information for conducting a thorough result analysis. 
### Write your first test with JMeter 
Once you've downloaded JMeter and the machine's setup is ready, it's time to write your first test. When you open the JMeter GUI, you'll see an empty test plan. Rename this test plan to correspond with the project you're developing load tests for. Naming the test plan is one of the first steps toward creating a clear and concise testing environment. It ensures that anyone who opens your project understands its contents.
The goal of load testing is to simulate user interaction with an application. To do this, you should create some users. So let's do it. Add a Thread Group within Threads (Users) to create a new configuration for simulating user behavior.
The Thread Group controls the number of ""users"" (threads), allowing you to manipulate the application's load. Besides the number of users, you can manipulate their access to the app as well. Some applications need to withstand prolonged activity from a steady number of users, while others must handle bursts of massive user entries in short periods. This flexibility helps you simulate various scenarios, ensuring your application can manage different types of user interactions.
Once the user group is defined, you can start defining the test. To specify the action the “user” will perform, you need to add an HTTP request. This request contains all the necessary details and data for the request that's going to be performed and has to be added to the Thread Group. Requests should be made in the order the actions are performed; for example, if logging in is the first action, place that request first. To avoid overloading requests, you can predefine values such as URLs and variables. 
All elements must be added within the Thread Group in order for them to be applied to it. If we assume that one base URL is needed throughout the application, define it in the HTTP Request Defaults Config element. To make it even more uniform, create a variable for it in the User Defined Variables Config element.
To add a variable, simply click on “Add” at the bottom and define its name and value. Then, use this value from now on everywhere where it’s needed to reduce time and effort in case change is needed. Variables in JMeter are called with: ${variable_name}.
Now, use this variable within HTTP Request Defaults:
Once the necessary pre-definitions are made, you can create the requests. To do this, you need to know the application's API calls and the required parameters for executing it. Each request should be named according to the action it performs.
With the base URL defined, it doesn't need to be specified for each request; HTTP Request Defaults will handle that. What needs to be defined is the protocol, method, and path to which the request is being sent. Parameters that have to be sent within the request can be sent as a file, defined parameters, or in a free format such as JSON.
When writing tests and debugging, use the Run command from the GUI, but once you’re sure the tests are ready for serious execution, use the CLI.
Save the test plan in .jmx format to be able to run it with the command:
##### run sh jmeter -n -t nameoftestplan.jmx -l nameofresultsfile.jtl*
*nameofresultsfile.jtl - this file doesn’t have to be created, it will be created automatically
### Analyzing the results
To analyze and verify the test outcomes, you should add some listeners. JMeter offers a variety of listeners, each providing specific analytical value. Some are more graphical, while others are more analytical. Choose wisely based on the value it'll bring you, and don't be afraid to play around with them until you find what fits you the best. 
In this example, I’ll show you a Response Time Graph
The Response Time GraphX-axisY-axis
This test plan includes a Thread group of 200 users with a ramp-up period of 10 seconds. There are 14 tests in total, including login, 12 specific feature tests, and logout – all covered in the Main features group.
You can see here that some requests are approaching 6000 ms, and this exact number is important because it’s the critical number in response time analysis. Studies show that users are likely to stop using an application if they have to wait 6 seconds or more for a response. In our case, this means that at least one of the 200 users who’s waiting for 6 seconds to complete an action, will probably exit and stop using the app. This scenario needs to be revisited by the development team, refactored, and tested again.
### A final takeaway
Load testing is not your day-to-day type of testing, but its approach can increase the application’s worth and make it better for users, with less fixing needed in production.
After learning the basics, you’re ready to dive into the practical use of JMeter and its functionalities in order to execute load testing. Stress your application, but don’t let it stress you!

# How to Organize Your Research Material and Analyze Your Research Data Digitally
Julia
UX Researcher
This is the first article in our series “Managing your UX Research Remotely”. 
Before Corona, [UX research at COBE](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services/ux-research-agency) meant interviewing people, preferably at their homes or at the place where they actually use the products we are interviewing them about. In any case it was all about interacting with them and talking to them directly, personally, face-to-face.
The same goes for the analysis and synthesis phases that follow the interviews: UX research at COBE was a lot of non-digital work and personal interaction among our team members with evaluating the insights in discussions, sticking post-its all over our office walls, and creating frameworks in the form of personas and customer journeys by setting up a blueprint on a poster on the wall or floor and rearranging post-its on it.
Basically, we felt like we had established a great process that allowed us to conduct UX research in a very effective and efficient way.
Then COVID came along — and suddenly, we could no longer work together in the office or go to people’s homes to interview them. Conducting interviews, analyzing data and making sense of it in a collaborative process, as well as conducting user tests with prototypes, became a true challenge. So, we concluded, we had to reinvent our way of working, and find a new setup that serves our purpose and matches the new restrictions COVID imposes on us.
Along our journey, we discovered many great tools and learned a lot about them, and so we decided to share our insights in this series, which consists of three articles in which we describe how we transformed the steps of our research process into a fully remotely and digital setup*.
Since this was one of our major issues, we would like to start this series with how to organize research material and analyze research data in a fully digital setup.
How working Pre-Corona looked like
## What we needed
Fortunately, even before Corona, we thought about becoming more digital with our research process, because we wanted to create a research library or repository, in which we can store and access all our research insights. Since we conduct several research studies per year, all the studies and collected insights accumulate over time and it has become more and more crucial for us to have an overview of all studies and results we worked with in the past. This would allow us to quickly screen through previously conducted studies and thus enable us to build upon the knowledge we’ve already collected.
## Meet Dovetail
For this purpose, we tested several software tools and ended up with Dovetail (
## Setting categories, creating tags and visualizing data
For the analysis, the process we usually followed was going through each transcript individually, writing each single information or insight on a separate post-it and then starting to map the post-its on the wall in order to identify categories and patterns. Here, Dovetail turned out to be a great support: It lets you tag information and insights with different labels that can be created during the tagging process and which can be freely named. By simply selecting a piece of text and highlighting it, a tag can be added to that piece of text. By this, our process of selecting important information and clustering insights was transferred into the digital world in a very efficient and insightful way: Tagging single pieces of information will bring these pieces of information together, so clusters are created automatically. This allows us to uncover patterns across the research data.
Tagging information in Dovetail Tag Overview in Dovetail
In addition, Dovetail also offers some quite nice features that, for example, let you visualize information in the form of graphs or to filter for tagged information. You can also create highlights of the tagged information (Highlights are groups of insights to which you can add pictures, text etc. and that describe what your finding is about).
By this, you can create a research library, in which you have all your research highlights and findings in one place, and which you can search if you need specific information within previous study results.
Another great feature is that dovetail allows collaboration through comments and mentions, which makes working together on a project easy and efficient.
Graphs & diagrams in Dovetail Highlights & search in Dovetail
## Our concluding thoughts on Dovetail
Up to now, we have worked with dovetail for over a year in several projects and different kinds of studies, and we are quite satisfied with the features and opportunities it provides us with. However, we still miss some features or see room for improvement.
For example, Dovetail offers to automatically transcribe uploaded video and audio data. So far, this has not really worked that well for us, because even though both languages we conduct studies in (German & English) are supported, the results are not too good. Especially in German, which is the language of most of our research studies, the results of the automated transcripts are quite disappointing. In general, the transcripts in both languages still require a lot of proofreading, and the effort for doing this is almost as high as having an additional person creating the transcript themselves.
Also, for the visualizations of the results in the form of charts we missed some features and further options.
Most of all, we found ourselves wishing that working with Dovetail would be a bit more entertaining, because — no matter how effective and efficient the tool is — it can sometimes be a bit dull to use, since the interface is super simple. However, we can absolutely live with that as a trade-off for everything Dovetail has to offer, because, in general, it is a very powerful tool that supports us quite well in reaching our aim to have a research repository and one go-to place for our insights.
## What’s next?
So since Dovetail turned out to be the right choice for us when it comes to the organization, management and analysis of research material, it was time for us to take a look at the next step in our research process. How could we transform our usual workflow of creating frameworks such as personas from our insights into a fully digital process? This is what our next article in this series will be all about.

# How to Implement a CI/CD Workflow for iOS Using GitHub Actions
Ivan
iOS Development
Development time is precious, as you all know it. So if you wonder if there’s a way to save all that precious time, I’ve got some good news for you. Say goodbye to manual deployment struggles, and welcome CI/CD!
In this article, you’ll learn how to automate the process of deploying your builds to testers, using TestFlight. But, before you start anything, you need to have your app signed - this includes registering your app ID, making a certificate, and a provisioning profile. To find out more about this topic, just 
In order to set up a CI/CD with TestFlight you’ll have to:
  * Register your app on App Store connect
  * Add testers
  * Generate an API key on App Store connect
  * Set up GitHub actions and upload secrets 


Now that you're familiar with the steps, let's go through each and every one of them in more detail. Just follow along.
### Registering the app on App Store Connect
Go to App Store Connect and press the apps tab. Here you should see a list of all your apps (if you have any).
Now, press the plus button next to the ‘Apps’ title.
Right about now, you should see a pop-up form. Most of the information is self-explanatory so it shouldn't be a problem for you to fill it out. Don't worry about SKU – it's a unique ID for your app in the Apple system and it won't be visible to other users.
You just registered your app to App Store Connect! Now, let’s add testers to the app.
#### Adding testers
Your app can be delivered to two types of testers, internal and external. For external ones, your application needs to go through Beta App Review, while for the internal ones, it doesn’t.
For more information about internal/external testers, 
Now, it’s time to create an internal testing group – to do that, click the plus sign:
Assign a name to the group and enable automatic distribution
When created, add testers to this group by clicking on the plus sign next to ‘Testers’.
Select all users that you want to test builds from this application. If you have trouble finding all of them, go to ‘Users and Access’ and then add them. Afterward, all testers will receive an email invitation.
Congrats, you’ve just finished setting up your testers! Now, you’ll implement a CI/CD flow using GitHub actions.
### GitHub Actions
Select the ‘Actions’ tab on your repository and choose the Simple workflow template. This is the easiest way to start using GitHub actions, as it will create all the essentials that you need to have in a workflow.
By clicking on the Simple workflow, GitHub will create the .github/workflows folder
Feel free to rename this file. Now, it’s time to write your own action containing the continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) parts.
### CI part
In this part, you'll archive your project into a folder containing your '.ipa' file.
I'm sure you already know how to do this manually, but let’s see how to automate the process. Find the code for this 
Firstly, you need to set the name of your action. Secondly, decide on the event it should trigger on. Set this to be on push request and on the main branch.
In the third step, create your job and assign a runner it will run on. Write this to be ‘macos-latest’. 
##### runs-on: macos-latest
In the example above, the action is running on a self-hosted runner. This is why you see ‘self-hosted’ as the value. 
In the fourth step, go to your GitHub repository and check if the code from it is available on the device your actions are running on. This action will use an already created 
Then, in the fifth step, you should install any dependencies you have – in the example above, I don’t use any. In case you do use dependencies, remove all comments from this step.
Finally, import all necessary secrets using the ‘env’ key. Adding secrets comes a bit later in the article. The rest of the code decodes files from a base64 string, saves the certificate, and applies the provisioning profile.
### CD Part
To implement CD, you’ll need four pieces of information:
  * Path to your .ipa file
  * Issuer ID
  * App Store Connect API key ID
  * App Store Connect private key 


You know the first one, but to get the other three, you need to generate an API key. You can find the steps to do this
Afterward, you should be able to see the needed information shown as in the picture below. Also, keep in mind that you can only download the private API key once.
Now, let’s go through the code in your .yml file.
The first step would be to build your application using the provided scheme and archive it. Secondly, you should export the archive with the export options that are decoded from a base64 string. ‍ The third step is optional
As I mentioned, this step is not necessary for the flow to work. But if you decide to add it, you’ll be able to find the files in the summary of the executed workflow.
The fourth step is removing whitespaces in the file name, in case you have them. If not, skip this step.
In the fifth step, you need to decode the App Store Connect private key from base64 and save it. You should store your key in one of these locations:
  * ./private_keys
  * ~/private_keys
  * ~/.private_keys
  * ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys 


When saving the private key file, it should contain an APP KEY ID in its name so the altool can find it, in the format of AuthKey_{APP KEY ID}.p8.
In the last step, validate and upload your app using altool. The altool generates a JWT token to be able to communicate with App Store Connect. This is done using your private API key, its ID ad app issuer ID.
Full commands are:
##### xcrun altool — validate-app -f [path/to/.ipa] -t ios — apiKey ${{ secrets.APPSTORE_API_KEY_ID }} — apiIssuer ${{ secrets.APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID }}
##### xcrun altool — upload-app -f [path/to/.ipa] -t ios — apiKey “${{ secrets.APPSTORE_API_KEY_ID }}” — apiIssuer “${{ secrets.APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID }}”
That is it for the yml file! Now, it’s time to import the secrets you used under the ‘env’ key.
#### GitHub secrets
You can edit your secrets by going to repo settings -> secrets -> actions.
There, you’ll see two containers, one for the current repository and one for the organization. Secrets added to the first one are only available to the current repository, while the organization’s secrets are available in all repositories that belong to that organization.
Click on the button to add a new repository secret. Write ‘APPSTORE_API_KEY_ID’ as the secret name. For the value, put in your key id. Then, press ‘Add secret’.
Good, you just added a secret to your repository! If you look in the .yml file, you'll see you're using this secret:
For string secrets, this works just fine. But, how will you upload files?
Also as strings! You just need to encode them first. You can do that through your command-line interface (CLI) with the command:
##### openssl base64 -in [fileName] | pbcopy
This will encode your file to a base64 string and copy it to your clipboard.
Add a new repository secret and call it IOS_EXPORT_PRODUCTION. Open the terminal at your archived files folder and encode the ExportOptions.plist file.
##### openssl base64 -in ExportOptions.plist | pbcopy
Paste the base64 string as the value of your secret and add it.
Then, add all other necessary secrets as either normal strings, or encoded as base64 strings, if they’re files. To see all the secrets, check the image below:
Let’s see what each of these secrets represents: 
  * APPSTORE_API_KEY_ID


  * APPSTORE_API_PRIVATE_KEY


  * APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID


  * IOS_EXPORT_PRODUCTION


  * IOS_PROD_CERTIFICATE


  * IOS_PROD_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD


  * IOS_PROVISION_PRODUCTION


At this point, you successfully added CI/CD with GitHub actions. There’s only one thing left for you to do, and it’s to use them.
### TestFlight
If you make a new push to your main branch, your build will be uploaded to TestFlight. So go ahead, go to TestFlight and find your build. If you don’t see it, check if your GitHub action failed or if you’ve received an email about any failures.
If everything works, your uploaded build will be in the ‘Processing state’.
After a couple of minutes, it’ll finish processing and show the ‘Missing Compliance’ alert:
To fix this you can click on ‘Mange’ and press ’No’ so that you don’t use any encryption. Of course, if your app does use encryption, you should go for the second option. Then press the ‘Start Internal Testing’ button.
This fixes the problem – your build is now ready and will be available for internal testers.
Even though this is a good way to do it, it can get annoying if you have to do it manually every time. So, in the true spirit of CI/CD, there’s an even better way to do it.
By changing the ‘App Uses Non-Exempt Encryption’ key in the info.plist file, you can make this automatic. TestFlight is checking this key to see if your app uses encryption. Since you don’t have this by default, it requires you to manage this manually by saying if you use encryption or not.
To make this clear, go to your info.plist file and add the ‘App Uses Non-Exempt Encryption’ key, and set its value to ‘NO’.
From now on, when you want to release a new build to your internal testers, just make a new push on the main branch.
That's right! You don’t need to think about releasing your build to testers anymore. All it takes is a single push!
### The end 
Congrats, you’ve just learned how to make the signing and the delivery process of your app automatic! 
Initially, it takes a bit longer, but setting up a CI/CD workflow is worth it in the long run. Just think about how you won’t need to do any extra work every time you push a new build of your app.
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. And if everything’s clear, go ahead and share your newly found skill! 💪🏼

# How to Implement Inclusivity into Your UX/UI Design
Ena
UX/UI Designer
Welcome back! I hope you enjoyed the first part of this blog post, where we talked about the basics of inclusive design and highlighted some benefits it can bring to brands. 
If you haven't read it yet, [make sure to do so before jumping into this one](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/introduction-to-inclusive-ux-ui-design). Now, let's dig deeper and discuss what aspects you should consider to make your design empathetic and respectful for diverse users. 
### Essential Principles and Practices
When designing a web or mobile app, you should follow these design principles to ensure that the UX/UI is:
  * Clear
  * Powerful‍
  * Specific


Inclusive design is a process that takes time and constant refinement. To create an intuitive user experience, start with UX research
### Information Architecture
Organizing information clearly and logically in digital products is crucial for helping users find what they need. This is particularly important for visually impaired users who rely on assistive technology that converts written text on screens into speech. 
To ensure that, focus on layout as an essential aspect of design:
  * Make the layout responsivedifferent screen sizes and resolutions
  * Ensure the interface has clear and consistent navigation
  * Provide alternative navigation options, like keyboard shortcuts,


### Content
The next important thing to consider is content and inclusive language, which should be crafted to respect all users, stressing simplicity and tone to make everyone feel welcome. According to the Nielsen Norman Group, content must be easily visible so users with specific challenges can still experience the presented information. Some features like speech functionality
Let me give you one common example. CTA buttons labeled “Learn more” or “Click here” can often lack clarity outside their context, hindering inclusivity. To improve usability in this case, consider renaming such labels. Instead of saying “Get started,” go for something more specific, such as “Book a meeting”. This will make the users feel they’re starting a valuable journey. That’s why you should: 
  * Reduce mouse clicks
  * Ensure clickable UI components are adequately sizedand spaced apart 
  * Avoid interactions that rely on timing.


#### Typography
Did you know there are around 7.5 million people with dyslexia in Germany alone? This data tells us how important it is to use typography that's easy to read, which involves selecting fonts that are legible and readable. Legibilityreadability
  * Maintain a line length that allows comfortable reading
  * Use accessible typefaces that are readable at both small and large sizes. You should also ensure that individual letter forms are distinct (e.g., I, l, 1, and 0 and O are different). For example, you can't go wrong with Sans-serif.
  * Use font size and line width to determine line height for easier reading. Too tightly spaced lines can reduce readability, making it difficult for the eye to know where to return when the line breaks.


Use actual text instead of images
#### Colors
To make your design inclusive, use high-contrast color combinations. This will help users with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies easily recognize different components by focusing on the contrast ratio.
Pay attention to the contrast ratio between text and background
  * A – basic/minimum level of accessibility 
  * AA – mid-range level of accessibility; the compliance level that most organizations strive to meet
  * AAA – the highest level of accessibility; the optimal compliance level that maximizes accessibility and enhances user experience


Keep in mind that not everyone perceives colors the same way. Therefore, color shouldn't be the only way to convey information
#### Multimedia
For years, UX/UI designers have used minimal illustrations with outlines and colorful hair to be more generic and inclusive. But without skin tones and distinct features, these figures often ended up looking white, unintentionally excluding others. To truly represent diversity, multimedia, like photos and illustrations should show a wide range of human characteristics and activities:
  * Avoid stereotypical depictions of professions and make sure to include people with disabilities.
  * Pay attention to details like left-handed users or those with prosthetic limbs.


When it comes to multimedia, alt text
Plus, it's useful for those with slow internet connections. By providing key details about an image, alt text ensures everyone can enjoy and interact with the content equally:
  * Avoid terms like ""image"" or ""picture,"" as screen readers already convey this information. Instead, try to describe an image or illustration in as much detail as possible like in the image below.


Most animations, videos, and moving text are usually harmless. However, some designers insist on using dramatic flashing or flickering light effects, such as strobe effects, especially in video content. These effects can cause continuous screen flashing
Let's not forget a crucial part of video content — captions. They help those with hearing impairments and people in noisy environments. Nowadays, most social media videos come with captions, making it easier to watch them without sound, especially when you're out in public.
### Useful Figma Plugins to Check Accessibility
There are many plugins that can help you review and improve your design. Here are some of them:
  * Contrast Checker 
  * Stark
  * Color Blind
  * A11y
  * A11y Focus Orderer


### Final Thoughts
And that's that! I hope this blog post helped you understand why inclusive design is crucial for creating a welcoming space and making simpler, more successful products.
Always prioritize empathy and social responsibility in every design phase. By doing so, you'll enhance usability for everyone, which will result in higher engagement. It's more than just a step; it's a guiding principle that drives impactful design. 🪄

# How to Prepare for the PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner Exam
Josipa
Product Owner
When you work in a very agile environment, you know it's all about efficiency and flexibility. There are no three hierarchies of approval, no big piles of documentation, and most importantly – developers can get to work straight away.
But what's happening behind the curtains? As the agile method is quite flexible and often relies on improvisation, it's not that uncommon to lack control during certain work processes. This is where PRINCE2 comes in handy. So, if you're interested in agile practices but have never heard of the PRINCE2 Agile Practitioner exam, or you’re just not sure if you should take it – you're in the right place.
### What is Prince2 Agile?
For those unfamiliar with this certification, let's start with the basics. How do the PRINCE2 method and agile work together? While PRINCE2 consists of principles, themes, and processes designed to ensure project viability through its life cycle, agile is all about producing value fast and with constant team improvements. And what do you get when you blend these two? Well, you get a pretty powerful combination of control and flexibility, or in other words, the PRINCE2 Agile.
This method will mostly benefit:
  * organizations using PRINCE2 that want to become more agile
  * agile teams that are lacking process and are looking for better project directions


#### But first – the prerequisites
You like the idea of getting the PRINCE2 Agile Certification and you want to apply for the Practitioner exam? Great! But, before you do that, make sure you have at least one of the following certifications:
  * PRINCE2 Foundation or any other PRINCE2 certification
  * Project Management Professional® (PMP)
  * Certified Associate in Project Management® (CAPM)
  * IMPA Levels A, B, C, and D® (Certified Projects Director)


For more information about the above-mentioned certificates, please visit 
#### Financial aspect and validity
The Practitioner level certification costs around 500 dollars – this covers a training course and an exam voucher. If you’re not able to pay for it yourself, think about asking your employer to help you out. Introduce him to all the benefits this certificate will bring to both you and the company. Take it from me; even though I originally planned to pay for the certification myself, COBE jumped in to cover the expenses for me. 
Anyway, once you pass the exam (and I'm sure you will), your certificate will last up to 3 years
### Examination - what to expect?
The practitioner-level test examines the implementation“open book” type, 
You can expect 50 questions, and the passing mark is 60%
For a multi-choice test, the pass mark is pretty high, however, don't let that fool you. It's not as easy as you might think, so yes, you'll have to study to pass. 
The correct answer will never be obvious – all given options can lead you astray, especially if you have knowledge gaps or trouble concentrating. Even though I studied a lot, some questions were very confusing as all the given answers could be the right ones. So be careful and make sure to understand the questions. 
Regarding the exam duration, you can count on 150 minutes
### How to prepare?
#### Buy the book
As I mentioned previously, you can only bring AXELOS official literature to the exam – **The PRINCE2 Agile Handbook** The other book they have, Managing successful projects,
I found mine for 125£ 
When you start with the studying, focus on the in-depth understanding of the PRINCE2 method, and think about how you can apply it to the projects in your organization too. Tab corresponding pages in the book so you can quickly look them up when needed.
#### Repetition is the mother of knowledge
The biggest part of the questions is scenario-based. You won't be able to apply techniques correctly if you don't understand the rationales behind every Focus area, PRINCE2 theme, Constraint control, Process tailoring, etc. 
So, again – you need to know the basics. If you have access to the PRINCE2 Agile Foundation level course, it would be wise to repeat it. Otherwise, stick to the Handbook.
#### Practice exams
AXELOS provides 
#### A bonus
If you have the opportunity to check tutorials at AXELOS ""Content hub"", I would suggest looking up the series ""Passing your PRINCE2 Agile examination"" from Keith Richards, the lead author, and the Chief Examiner. 
As those are restricted resources, I can't share any specifics, but let me mention a few general tips:
  * Read questions carefully. What are they really asking you about?
  * Go through all answers before choosing one.
  * Understand the scenario.
  * Always be aware of the big picture. Think about the timeline, team maturity, stakeholders, and anything that might influence the situation and affect the result.
  * Reality is never black or white, so don't be surprised if a scenario is in a grey zone as well.


### In the end, was it worth it?
Definitely yes! PRINCE2 is one of the most popular certifications in the PM world, which is why I proudly wear the Practitioner badge. It will introduce a little order in your agile environment, but it won't restrain you with a bunch of rules; it will help you with something that you already know by heart. For example, that you:
  * Always need to assess the business justification
  * Should expect change as something inevitable, and carefully control it
  * Need a good risk management
  * Should choose an approach depending on the complexity of the situation
  * Need proactive management to improve team communication 


To me, the most important part is that I could take the learned practices and apply them to our projects right away. I noticed it really makes a difference as it:
  * Helps to increase transparency
  * Boosts improvement
  * Detects issues at an early stage and enables a fast reaction
  * Helps with prioritization and proper MVP definition
  * Controls all project aspects as it meets all objectives


To wrap it up, this method boosts productivity by introducing control but leaving enough flexibility for team organization. As a result, you'll get happy clients, a happy team, and a happy revenue.
I hope you find this walkthrough helpful in choosing the right certification for you – no matter if you follow my steps or choose a different career path. In any case, I encourage you to keep learning and working on constantly improving yourself. I wish you the best of luck.

# How to Midjourney: A New Way of Creativity
Daniel
Co-Founder & Managing Director
Artificial intelligence doesn't stop at the creative scene – the current and hot topic: AI-based programs such as ""Midjourney"" or ""Dall-E-2"". Both tools use simple terms or text phrases from users to generate complex images that can even be used to win art competitions.
Using “Midjourney” as an example, we'll show you how you can use the tool to turn words into images within a few seconds and talk about potentials where it can be used in the future.
### How does Midjourney work?
‍
  1. Log into Discord
  2. Visit the 
  3. Done! Welcome to the Midjourney Community!


Now it's time to create your own Midjourney AI image:
  1. Choose one of the existing ""newbies"" channels
  2. Type in the text field “/imagine” spaceenter
  3. The Midjourney Bot renders your image in 4 variants within 60 seconds


Tip: The use of terms and text phrases can be as simple as ""A pink elephant"", but through a targeted use and their sequence in the text, it's also possible to initially influence the result (coloring, form, rendering, image format, etc.) e.g. ""A pink elephant, in a room, full of trees, volumetric lighting, light caustics, octane render, ultra realistic, 16:9""
  1. Now you have several options: a) You export the image with all 4 variants (or don’t) b) You click on the “Reload” icon and get a new image direction of your input c) You choose a variant and have it rendered again individually (U = Upscale 1-4) d) You create further variants of a single variant (V = Variations 1-4) ‍ Tip: Keep an eye on your message with the free trial: once your image has finished rendering, it'll jump to the bottom of the chat. 


If you're wondering who owns the rights to all the images, Midjourney has commented on Discord this way: 
> “The creators now have ownership, but grant MJ a unlimited license. To be clear, one of the many things we use the unlimited license for is to continue to allow the remixing and openness the community enjoys.” 
Here's just a small selection of our results at COBE – we can't take our hands off Midjourney and create new images almost every day.
### What potential does Midjourney have?
‍
Can we see these creations as a cooperation between man and machine, i.e. between artists and artificial intelligence – or are the programs more comparable to a new tool, such as a brush and canvas? One thing's clear: the images that AIs create revolutionizes the previous approach and process of image creation.
Our pink elephant example shows how AI reinterprets individual words. Exactly these variations also make it exciting to work with.
But it's not just about the artistic process and the fun factor that makes these image-AIs so interesting. Such programs can also be used in daily business: For example, as a catalyst for brainstorming and mood board processes. Regardless of the creative industry, be it film, fashion, gaming or interior design: we already have the ability to visualize our thoughts within seconds using only language. Concept stages and decision-making processes are extremely shortened through the use of AI-based tools such as Midjourney.
### The end of creativity?
Such tools support, but don't replace the creativity and experience of a designer – only the conscious use leads to the goal. Because when we talk about commercial design, the saying “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” no longer suffices as a justification. It's precisely for this reason that we as a UX/UI agency have developed a scientifically based [UXi method](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/uxi-brand-experience-agency) that maps a comprehensible design process and at the same time ensures that the right brand values are represented in the digital product. The use of Midjourney enriches our daily business, as it can provide inspirational and guiding input for our UXi process at this point. ‍ …which brings us back to the question: Is this really the end of human creativity, or do we rather have to see the big picture, in which such tools ""only"" expand our possibilities of presenting ideas and thoughts visually?
But I'd also like to hear your opinion on this, so:

# How to Get Started With ReactJS
Ljubica
Web Development
I started working as a Web developer at COBE about three months ago. The first project I was assigned to was really big and it required skills I haven’t had mastered at the time. So, naturally, my first thoughts were “How am I going to do this?” I remember everything felt new to me, from working in an agile environment to learning different processes, but I didn’t panic. I knew what COBE was about, the value of my team and that I can count on people to help me out. Also, I remember thinking how in three months I’m probably going to laugh about all my concerns — and indeed, I am 😄.
The first few weeks went by quickly with an enormous support from my web team. The guys always made sure I understood everything. I remember I did a lot of research, watched tutorials and read articles on best practices, and whenever I felt stuck, my team managed to show me the way out. Some technologies I had to get more familiar with, for working on the project, were ReactJS, TypeScript, and GraphQL. 
Previously, I have worked with Ruby on Rails, eCommerce solutions and WordPress. I remember I was always intrigued by ReactJS, but I didn’t have the opportunity to learn it and work with it from scratch (if we exclude having a touch with it in terms of styling components). Little did I know I was going to write an article in the future on how to get started with ReactJS. But here I am! 🤗
Since I’ve mastered [UI development](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services), regarding modern HTML, CSS (including its frameworks as well as pre- and post-processors), responsive web design and jQuery, I was ready for something more. And that’s why I came to COBE.
### GraphQL
I started off my learning journey with GraphQL — it took me about a day to get into it. One of my teammates explained it very thoroughly for me: “This is the interface, this is where you write queries, here you can write variables and there you’ll get your response. There are schemas and docs, you can search both query and response, and that’s pretty much it.” And honestly, I didn’t need much more information than that. But you can find more, 
###### GraphQL interface
### ReactJS & TypeScript
When it came to learning ReactJS and TypeScript, it wasn’t as simple as with GraphQL. For Typescript, I followed 
I was familiar with JavaScript before and had a basic understanding of its standard objects, expressions, operators and functions but then I came across 
I also came across an interesting Complete Intro to React Intermediate React
### Turning theory into practice
When I first started working on the project, I was mostly doing small bug fixes. But don’t get me wrong, finding a chunk of code to fix, at that time, took more time for me than fixing the bug itself. But at the end of the week, I always felt proud — for every bugfix I did, for every PR I created that got approved and for every “Well done team” we received from the client. 
It didn’t take long for me to start doing features instead of fixing bugs. Along with that, I started a deeper research of understanding data itself for the frontend side of development. Writing GraphQL queries and investigating samples of data are not a mystery to me now, as well as creating ReactJS components and styling them using styled-components, adding those to the Storybook, and populating them with real data. I’m also actively using TypeScript and trying to keep up with the latest ES standards.
Three months is not a long time, but for me it was just about enough time to find value in my new team and to learn new things. I’m starting to understand JavaScript better and I’ve noticed some positive changes in the way I write code. 
This one-liner function that returns an array of airports based on the locale param happened about two months ago. It may be nothing to you, but this single line of code made me so happy and proud. 😊 It’s so clean you can almost see it shining! No if-else statement, no return keyword, no let, no var and added type to the locale param.
Coding makes me happy, it’s simple as that. Of course, it doesn’t happen overnight, it takes a lot of time, motivation, and determination. But take small steps each day and make sure you have a goal in your head. Plus, if you have a great team that supports you and answers all your questions, you’re good to go. 
Happy learning and coding! 🤞

# How to Successfully Collaborate in Multi-Company Projects
Barbara
QA Engineer
In today’s business landscape, multi-company projects are becoming increasingly common as organizations combine resources and expertise to create the best product in the market. However, cross-company collaboration can introduce unique challenges – from differing terminologies and cultural backgrounds to varying processes and workflows. To ensure smooth, effective teamwork, it's essential to establish clear expectations and roles from the start. 
As a Quality assurance engineer, in this article I'll share insights from a recent project where we partnered with a company that had never worked with a QA team before. By defining responsibilities early on, we created a shared understanding that allowed seamless collaboration between both teams.
Keep reading to find out which strategies can help you navigate and optimize collaboration in multi-company projects.
### The Challenge
The project I’ll refer to in this blog post is a [data platform in the automotive industry](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/projects/data-portal) developed for data scientists, governance teams, engineers, and many other roles. Now in its fourth year, this project serves as an excellent example of successful multi-company collaboration.
Data portal home page
When the project first started, our team consisted of just 20 people. However, over the years, it has expanded to 60 members, encompassing a range of roles — from stakeholders and product owners to designers, developers, and QA engineers. All of us were spread across three companies located in three different countries. While this diversity brought valuable perspectives, it also came with challenges, like building mutual understanding and adapting to cultural differences. How did we deal with it? With communication. 
### Let’s Talk About It 
Effective communication is essential to the success of any project, especially when multiple companies are collaborating. Clear, consistent communication allows teams to collaborate smoothly, coordinate efforts, and achieve shared goals.
If you work in Scrum, as we do, make sure that all team members participate in Scrum ceremonies, like daily stand-ups, retrospectives, refinements, and planning sessions. Internal meetings within your company are just as important. They’re a chance to update management and your internal team on project progress. I encourage you to be active in those meetings, focusing on open, respectful communication to ensure every opinion is heard and valued.
To identify areas for personal growth and further strengthen your collaboration, you should give each other feedback from time to time. Try organizing regular retrospectives––
### Establishing Workflows and Team Collaboration
Successful collaboration in multi-company projects starts with setting up clear workflows. A well-defined workflow ensures everyone knows their roles, responsibilities, and how they depend on each other. The goal is to have teams from different companies work together seamlessly, which boosts overall project efficiency. This clarity can help teams coordinate effectively, complete tasks on time, and meet deadlines, all of which are critical for the project’s success.
So, how do you establish a good workflow?
To tailor your team setup to the project’s scope and requirements, start by assessing its strengths, weaknesses, and specific needs
To put things into perspective — one of our four teams includes a product owner, a designer, a QA engineer, and six developers. This structure didn’t happen overnight; it evolved over the years as we refined our approach to meet project needs better. Try experimenting with different team combinations to find what works best for you.
Effective collaboration benefits both the team and the client. Diverse perspectives and creative problem-solving from each company boost innovation and lead to higher-quality results.
### Effective Collaboration and Sharing Updates
To achieve effective collaboration on a multi-company project, it’s crucial to invest in transparent communication — not just within the project team, but also with stakeholders. How? You might ask. 
Keep everyone in the loop by sharing frequent updates on the project's progress, any potential challenges, and upcoming milestones. This will help teams coordinate better, address issues quickly, and, ultimately, deliver higher-quality results. Plus, transparency builds trust and confidence in the project with clients as well. Keeping them updated will also allow them to give timely feedback, helping the project stay aligned with their changing needs and expectations.
This proactive approach reduces disruptions and keeps the project running smoothly
### Recognizing Achievements
Recognizing project achievements along the way is essential. Our international team comes together every year to celebrate what we've accomplished and look ahead to the year to come. You can share achievements and milestones through any communication channel you choose, like emails, meetings, and company newsletters — just make sure everyone from your team is being acknowledged.
The great thing is you can create traditions
Feel free to use this idea if it works for you. 
### Project Success
The main goal of any project is to complete it successfully and meet your client’s expectations. What’s great about multi-company projects is that they combine knowledge and expertise from different areas, which can greatly improve the quality
### Team Work and Project Improvement
Teams from different companies can learn from one another and share best practices and innovative techniques, which leads to continuous improvement. This type of collaboration can help projects adapt to changes and align with the latest industry standards. For clients, this means receiving a final product that’s not only up-to-date but also refined through multiple experts.
### To Sum Up
Working on large, long-term projects can be challenging, especially when multiple companies are involved. It requires strong organization, clear roles, and a shared commitment to the same goal. However, when done right, it can provide numerous growth opportunities, inspire innovation, and enable you to deliver real value to users.

# How to Turn Research Insights Into Frameworks Digitally
Julia
UX Researcher
From the Series “Managing your UX Research Remotely”. This is the second article in our series*, which is concerned with the transforming of UX Research workflows into digital processes. After explaining how we transferred our fully analog process of analyzing and organizing our research data into the digital world with the help of Dovetail, this article is all about how to turn research insights into frameworks such as personas, when working in a completely digital and remote setup.
## What we needed
Dovetail offered us a great solution for building a research library and optimizing our analysis process. However, we still needed tool support for our remote synthesis process, in which we bring all the insights and information together to create valuable take-aways in the form of frameworks such as UX Personas, Customer Journeys, Opportunity Boards etc. For this step of the process, we were looking for a tool that allowed us to transfer our process of working with post-its and poster blueprints into the digital world.
## Meet Miro
The tool we ended up with was more or less a workaround, which is not only easy to use but also quite fun to use: Miro (
We have used Miro at COBE for quite some time already for a wide range of purposes. So, when we were faced with having to come up with a workaround for the synthesis process we turned to Miro out of habit and availability — and it turned out to be the best decision we could have made. Miro allows us to still set up the blueprints we work with for preparing our frameworks as we did when physically working together, but in an improved way. Why? Because, just like Dovetail, it can be accessed from everywhere at any time, which was a great advantage compared to our research room in the office.
## Following different routes for building frameworks
But that’s not it: Miro combines the best of both the digital and physical world, since we can still follow the process we used to follow when working together physically (i.e., setting up a blueprint, arranging the information on it in form of post-its etc.), while being able to use features like delete, undo, or copy & paste etc to play around and see how frameworks could be best set up. This flexibility allows us to quickly develop and visualize different versions of frameworks, which makes it easier to decide which way to go.
In addition to the collaboration over Miro, we use Discord which offers the option of voice calls, as it is still easier to talk about stuff instead of writing back and forth. In Discord you can open up so-called “rooms” or you are in one-on-one “conversations”, which you can just enter and you can talk with each other on demand — you are constantly available as if you were sitting in the same room, but do not feel pressured to constantly talk with each other. Like this, we are able to work together on the Miro board and in case we need to discuss or clarify anything, we can just talk with one another over Discord. This turned out to be a really good way of collaborative working for our synthesis process.
## Visualizing correlations, creating the bigger picture — and enjoying the process
The linking features in Miro also allow us to visually link information and thus get a better overview over the interrelations of insights. We can also include images to gain a better understanding of the bigger picture. Furthermore, by already setting up the information and the content of the frameworks in a digital form, it is easier for our designers to later transfer the content into the final design (i.e. a digital poster) and it makes it easier for us to be more precise when defining scales and ratings.
Like Dovetail, Miro also served as a space for documenting and storing insights to access it later on — another benefit compared to the physical blueprints, which we basically just threw away after a project was completed.
Another convincing advantage of Miro is that — especially in direct comparison to Dovetail — it is great fun to work with: Being able to highlight information with different colors, linking pieces of information together to visualize how they correlate, and tweaking things is so much fun that you really have to be careful to not get carried away or lose yourself in all the amazing details.
Our synthesis process in Miro
## Conducting interviews
However, Miro was not only great for creating frameworks out of existing insights. It also helped us conduct remote interviews.
We usually conduct the interviews at people’s homes or the place of usage of the product or service we’re interviewing them about. With COVID, personal interviews were off the table, and we had to find other solutions.
While video calls basically did the job, they don’t allow us to get additional information about the living situation or the surroundings of the place of usage you normally get when physically visiting a place. This information is quite useful for getting a better and holistic understanding of the participants, their needs, the circumstances, etc. and helps us to better interpret and classify the information we get. Also, we often bring material with us that we show participants during interviews and that we ask them questions about.
Now, while Miro couldn’t help us with the first problem of not being able to experience the participant’s environment, it did help us with integrating material into the interviews. With Miro, we don’t have to share our screen while interviewing, but can simply share a Miro board with the participants to see how they interact with certain information, how they navigate through it etc. as Miro offers the option to “follow” a user’s interaction.
For these cases, we can prepare the board for the interviews in whatever form we need. It can be used to show pictures, walk through scenarios, brainstorm about different ideas or solutions, or do card sorting with participants, and we can use it for one-on-one interviews as well as for focus groups.
## Our concluding thoughts on Miro
Miro is a great and very fun tool to work with. While the opportunities to structure and design boards appear to be endless, Miro is still super easy to use, which is especially important when using it in collaboration with interview participants. So far, we have not experienced anything negative worth mentioning here — Miro has simply turned out to be a real allrounder and helped us with many different tasks.
## What’s next?
Even though Miro helped us a lot for managing the synthesis phase and conducting interviews, it couldn’t help us with usability tests. In usability tests, we use prototypes of websites and apps, which we ask participants to interact with. We observe and talk to participants while they interact with these prototypes in order to understand their decisions and experiences. So, this is another step of the [UX Research](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services/ux-research-agency) process that we still needed to find a solution for.

# How UXi Ensures Consistency in Design Systems
Tim
Head of UX/UI
You’ve just bought a brand new, modern car that can do more than turn on the lights, and wow, when you connect your phone to it, you can play music directly from your Spotify! As you explore how it works, you realise it’s all very familiar – almost exactly like on your phone. As it turns out, Spotify feels exactly the same no matter where you use it.
And why is that? The answer is twofold: Spotify has an incredibly strong brand identity powered by a clearly well thought out design system. This is the key to building a strong user experience. Add our UXi method into the mix, and you’re on a good path of serving your customers exactlyjust
And why does it all work together so well? Let’s get into it.
### Why every digital touchpoint should reflect your brand
Design systems are the approach that ensures consistency across all touchpoints. Without a design system, you end up with different teams building the same components in different ways. One team makes a button with a 6-pixel corner radius, another uses 7. It may seem minor, but these inconsistencies affect how people perceive the brand.
Let’s go back to Spotify for a moment. Some years ago, their website, app, and integrations all looked and felt completely different. Then they built a strong design system aligned with their brand, and now everything is cohesive. Same goes for Airbnb – when you book something on the app or on the website, the animations and interactions are all the same and reflect their brand identity. A design system enables that kind of alignment across all platforms and teams. It defines things like colors, typography, spacing, and even motion design, ensuring consistency across all touch points.
A mockup of .
There are [many benefits](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/how-to-build-a-design-system) to using a design system, but one that’s particularly relevant to this article is consistency. You can look at consistency as the foundation that builds brand credibility. The starting point is figuring out what your brand stands for. [Our UXi method](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/what-makes-ux-inseparable-from-brand-identity) is a great way in taking that first step.
Let’s take a look at what happens when you add design systems into the equation.
### Building brands with systems
While there are white-label design systems out there – a kind of ready-made starter kits that you can customize – and while they're quite serviceable, they usually don’t get you to that deeply customized, brand-driven result. Sometimes, even strong brands haven’t fully translated their identity into digital. They define colors, maybe some additional UI elements, but don’t think deeply about how it’s perceived.
UXi bridges that gap – it’s there to make sure your product and its design language actually feel
Even with established brands, there’s often a gap between the branding and how it comes across digitally. By implementing design systems with the UXi method, we ensure that every brand expression aligns with the values the brand stands for. For example, the principle of “approachability” can mean different things, depending on the context.
Looking back at one of the projects I worked on, the client already had a defined brand and a design system, but visually, it felt somewhat… generic, uninspiring. Thousands of people use the client’s internal tools – but it wasn’t really feeling like the brand. So we needed to transport the brand values into the tool. When we came in, we applied our UXi method to really understand how the brand should 
When determining how a brand can be expressed through UX and UI, we usually run workshops with the client and then translate the outcome into a design system. For this specific client, once we had a solid foundation, a clear design vision, and alignment with all stakeholders, we developed a more refined, premium design language. The result was a design system that not only looked better but also gained internal traction. People actually wanted to use it – and that’s key. When it looks and feels right, people are far more likely to adopt it and use it.
### The long-term payoff
Building and maintaining a design system may seem daunting, especially in the beginning. Oftentimes, that tends to be a bottleneck in projects. Without a design system in place, you might move faster in the short term, but then a rebranding comes, and you have to redo everything. If you’d invested early in a design system, updates would be much easier – and future teams could hit the ground running with that foundation. Long term, using design systems means you save time and reduce costs. 
A true design system isn’t just a Figma library – it’s connected to code. Developers can see exactly how components should behave and reuse them. And when something changes, during a rebrand, for example, you only have to update that one shared component, and it will be reflected everywhere. A team that’s only, let’s say, working on the checkout process of a product, then doesn’t need to invent anything – they can simply look at the design system and know how every piece of the checkout process should look, keeping things consistent.
Here’s another angle: with digital products, complexity is only increasing. Spotify, again, is on in-car interfaces now – but it still feels like Spotify. That’s only possible because of their strong design system. It also helps with ideation and prototyping. One client told me, “Before, we needed a week or more to design new ideas. Now we can do it in a 1-day workshopjust grabbing components and experimenting
And of course, in the age of AI, design systems are critical. AI tools are starting to generate UI using your design components – but that only works if the system is clearly defined. If your design system includes all the right components and documentation, AI can assemble consistent screens that reflect your brand. Without it, AI wouldn’t even know which button or navigation style to use.
### A cohesive brand experience
As design systems are becoming more and more prominent, it’s easy to understand why. The consistency they offer isn’t just about making things look nice – it’s about building trust. When every digital touchpoint reflects your brand identity, users know what to expect, and that familiarity builds trust.
With the UXi, we make abstract values tangible, and thanks to design systems, we ensure we are truly translating a brand into a consistent digital experience. We create a documented foundation so anyone working on the brand can do it with the same mindset and understanding. All that bridges the gap between abstract brand values and tangible, usable design, so whether someone’s using your product on a phone, in a car, or on a smart TV, the experience always feels unmistakably “you.”
That’s the real payoff: a cohesive, intentional brand experience. If you think our UXi method is a good way to get you on that path, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

# How to Start Testing Bluetooth Apps: A Beginner's Guide
Katarina
Quality Assurance Lead
Testing Bluetooth apps can be challenging, especially if you’re a beginner in the world of quality assurance – trust me, we’ve all been there. Bluetooth is one of those technologies that seem very simple from a user perspective, but in reality, it’s often more complex. And wherever there’s complexity, there are also more chances something might potentially go wrong. This is why I decided to write this guide. Continue reading and learn everything you need to know about testing your first Bluetooth app. 
### But first, let’s talk about preconditions
Before you start the testing process, I suggest you learn all about the Bluetooth device you’re going to work with. First, cover the basics: What’s its purpose? What will it be used for? Afterward, you can dive in a bit deeper and learn more about its behaviour: 
  * how to turn it on/off
  * how to start its main functionality
  * how does the firmware behave in certain circumstances
  * which data does the device collect and store
  * what can you do with the device
  * which requirements and needs have to be fulfilled for a successful running


After answering these questions, you will officially have a solid knowledge of the Bluetooth device you plan to test. Now, what exactly does the testing part include, find out below. 
### First steps when testing your Bluetooth app 
#### ‍1. Pairing & connection 
Every Bluetooth device has its own way of connecting to the app. Some of them connect automatically and the connection just stays alive. But there are also Bluetooth apps that require specific pairing to connect to the Bluetooth device. Once the pairing is complete, the user can easily connect their Bluetooth app to the device, provided they turn on Bluetooth on their device, of course. 
Once you start testing, watch out for: 
  * the app’s behaviour when you accept or decline all the permissions needed for a successful connection with the Bluetooth device (e.g. iOS requires permission for using Bluetooth, while Android requires permission for using location)
  * the app’s behaviour when you try connecting more smartphones to the same Bluetooth device
  * the app’s behaviour if you have more than one Bluetooth device near your smartphone


The last two points can be especially tricky. For example, you want to connect your Bluetooth device to a particular smartphone, but you have opened the app on more than one device – there’s a high chance of every smartphone nearby trying to connect to it. A similar problem appears when you open the app on just one device but have more Bluetooth devices laying around. This is the part when the smartphone goes crazy because it doesn’t know which Bluetooth device to connect to. 
Do you know how many times I accidentally connected the Bluetooth device I was working with to the wrong smartphone? Too many. And let me tell you one thing, it’s not the most exciting part of the job to search for the phone that’s connected to the Bluetooth device – especially if you work with 10-15 testing devices on a regular basis. But what can you do. 🤷‍♀️ 
#### 2. Distance between the Bluetooth device and the app
I’m sure you’re aware of the impact distance between a Bluetooth device and an app has on the quality of the Bluetooth connection. There are going to be times when the user won’t be able to use the app and the device at the same time. That’s why it’s important to test how the connection will work when the smartphone and the Bluetooth device are not next to each other. 
#### 3. Firmware of the Bluetooth device
One of the biggest challenges was working on features related to the firmware of the Bluetooth device. It all started with the first firmware update, when some features that were working perfectly before, just stopped working or changed behaviour with the new firmware version. This was the moment I realized how complex Bluetooth testing can be. It's also when I recognized the importance of regression testing – if I didn't conduct it every sprint I wouldn't have even noticed the difference in the developed features after the firmware update. 
If your app has a “firmware update” feature, don't forget to take care of:
  * the download time – how much time does the download take 
  * what happens if the connection breaks while the download is in process
  * update time – how long does it take until the update is finished
  * what happens if the user closes the app during the update process (funny story - I once bricked a Bluetooth device while testing this case)
  * clearly describing the steps for the wanted user group
  * how does the frontend communicate with the backend when showing that a new firmware update is available, and how the data is shown in the app


It’s important to put yourselves in the user’s shoes when testing the firmware features – because if I managed to brick a Bluetooth device simply by closing the app in the middle of an update, then any user could do it. To elaborate… The old firmware version got deleted at the same moment I started the installation of the new version, which first led to an error and then bricking the Bluetooth device. Of course, this was unacceptable so we searched for a fix. And we found one! Now, if the user closes the app while the update is in progress, the app will find the bricked Bluetooth device and start the installation of the new firmware version again.
I’m mentioning this because this situation led me to one of the most important lessons in testing – different platforms, software versions, and devices communicate differently with the Bluetooth device. I faced scenarios where on a Samsung, everything would work perfectly, and then on Huawei, the same feature I tested before, would not work. Thereby, when you start testing, keep in mind to use as many devices and cover as many software versions as possible. And do it on every platform that supports the app. 
Hi, that's me. Casually testing. They caught me totally off guard.
#### ‍ 4. Data collecting and storing 
Data collecting and storing is one of the basic functions of every app – that implies Bluetooth apps, too. When testing data collecting and storing, keep in mind:
  * should the data be permanently stored or not
  * if there is no permanent storage, how long will the data be visible in the app
  * will the user have an option to choose if he wants to store the data or not
  * how should the data be displayed in the app
  * is the collecting done in real-time or will the data update be done after a specific amount of time 


These are just some of the generic cases you should test when we talk about data collecting and storing in the Bluetooth app, but, depending on the app expectations, there can be even more things to test. 
#### 5. Communication between the app and the Bluetooth device
Bluetooth communication is one of the most important functionalities to test in your app. If the communication doesn’t work, then the app probably doesn’t fulfill its purpose. That’s why you need to test:
  * is the communication fluent or not 
  * will the communication break after some time or not 
  * will the app features work as expected with the Bluetooth device
  * what happens if the communication breaks while the Bluetooth device is running and showing some data in the app 


### How Bluetooth testing improved my testing skills
Testing Bluetooth apps can be challenging at first, but the benefits you get out of it are worth it: ‍
  1. You will learn how to deal with projects of larger complexity
  2. You will become a true team player
  3. You will deal with every new Bluetooth project with more ease 


When testing Bluetooth apps, it’s important to stay organized and to accept help when needed – some things will be new to you. That way, you allow yourself to grow and you'll be able to improve your testing skills. But hey, reading this article is already a step in the right direction. Technically, you’re ready to test your first Bluetooth app. Congrats! If you run into any questions, feel free to contact me. 🤗

# Making a Career Switch Within the Same Company
Katarina
Marketing Lead
You’ve been working at the same company for a while now, you enjoy the culture, you identify with the company’s values, and you adore your team – but something’s missing. Your job doesn’t excite you anymore. Is it because you don’t see room for development any longer? Or maybe because you don’t see yourself in the same field anymore? Now, what to do in a situation like that? Well, if you work at a place that cares about you as an employee, sees your value, and wants to see you happy and thrive, you’ll probably have the option to make a career switch – without switching the company. 
Making a career switch inside your company is becoming more and more common – especially if you work in the software development industry. Our Business controller, Dolores, is the perfect example of this. She joined COBE as a Quality assurance specialist in 2018, and after two years of reporting every bug possible, she decided to take her career in a different direction – controlling. 
Keep reading to find out why she decided to take a step into the unknown and what her career switch process looked like. 
### Meeting our interviewee
Dolores, tell us about your beginnings at COBE. 
  * My career at COBE started four years ago when I applied for a QA specialist position. I was the first person to join Nikolina, the QA lead. Over the years, our team grew and I’ve gained more and more knowledge – not only in the quality assurance field, but in team building and organization too. I worked on the team development process with her and witnessed the growth from just two people to a strong team of six. Working in QA taught me how to be a team player, how to develop good interpersonal relationships, and how to be a mentor. It brought me a lot of technical knowledge too, which I find very useful in my current role. And even though two years might not be much to some, I can truly say that I’ve learned the most in these two years. I feel like it has built a base for my next role – Business controller. 


### Find the fire within
Now, when did the initial interest in Business controlling appear?
  * I’m not sure if there was a particular moment when I realized it, I just remember thinking how working in quality assurance doesn’t fulfill me anymore. And it didn’t have anything to do with the QA role itself, because even after two years, I still had so much left to learn. I just needed a new challenge – I needed to feel the fire within again. This is when my interest in business operations intensified, and after exploring my options and diving deep into the topics of controlling and analysis, I finally found my fire again. 


Would you say your interest in business operations led you to your new role? 
  * Yes, absolutely. When I decided it was time for a change, the first thing I did was look for all roles related to business management in software development. This is when I came across the business analyst and controller roles. As I continued my research, a new fire in me was awakened. Pretty soon I was sure that this was something I wanted to pursue, even though we didn’t have a Business team at COBE Osijek at that time. 


### No other company will give you the opportunity like your own
Making a career switch isn’t something you see or do every day. When did you decide to talk to someone about it? 
  * I remember this was happening right about our half-year feedback so I decided that that it was as good a time as any to propose my idea to the management team. I started by explaining how I wasn't feeling fulfilled in the role I was in anymore, and I finished by telling them how I wanted to start a new department at COBE Osijek (which we would all benefit from, hopefully). Honestly, I didn’t know what type of reaction to expect, but negative feedback didn’t even cross my mind. This is because I’ve always had the freedom to express my thoughts and interests at COBE. Here, we’re always being pushed to grow and take on new opportunities. And that’s exactly what this was – a new opportunity. 


You told me earlier that our management actually had other plans for you – they wanted to promote you to the QA team lead position, right? Did this information affect your decision in any way? 
  * I never thought about becoming the QA lead, so I felt honored. And even though I could’ve become a team lead, I was still more interested in starting my business controlling journey. It might sound crazy to some, but I preferred starting from scratch and being a junior again if it meant that I’d be doing something that I’m deeply interested in. My decision surprised them but in the best way possible. This was the first time I showed real confidence in a decision, and I think they recognized it and were proud of me. 


Did you, at any point, think about looking for a business-related position elsewhere? 
  * No. I loved (and still do) everything about COBE. It was just a career switch that I needed. 


### Prepare yourself for hard work
Now, what did the career switch process look like? Do you feel like it was more complicated since you were starting a whole new department at our Osijek office? 
  * It was a lot of work in the beginning. I was still booked as a QA specialist on a few projects, so, obviously, I couldn’t leave those overnight and just take over new responsibilities. I was also still learning and researching about my new position, educating myself, and working with the team on developing the best possible process for this new role. So it had been a busy few months until we straightened everything out, and until I completely changed my career direction. 


When did everything get real for you? How long until your role officially changed?
  * There was a lot of going back and forth in the beginning – from trying to define my responsibilities to making sure those responsibilities don’t overlap with the ones our project managers have. I started out as a Business analyst (BA) and the first time everything got real to me was when we sold BA as a service. This was when I was still trying to figure everything out and find my own place in the project. Fast forward to a couple of months later, when my close cooperation with our project management and product ownership teams issued a complete team reorganization. This resulted in me leaving the Business analyst role behind and tackling the sales and financial side of the business instead. It’s when I began my Business controller journey. And I couldn’t be happier about it. 


What made the career switch easier?
  * A supportive team. This whole process of creating a new position and defining responsibilities that go with it is hard. A lot of times I found myself lost in what I was doing, but having the support and educational opportunities COBE provides is what made the switch easier. 


What does your role take on today?
  * I overview all ongoing projects making sure they’re profitable – that includes budgeting, forecasting, reporting, tracking expenses, etc. In the beginning, I was also tackling sales, but as soon as we realized it was too much work, we hired another person. And then another. Now we’re a team of three, each handling their own responsibilities, but still working as a team. In the meantime, I got promoted to the lead position of this newly formed team, and everything’s been going really well. 


Besides a support system, what has helped you thrive in the position you’re in?
  * Having a mentor (actually multiple ones) has been the most important factor during this career switch. I’ve gained both knowledge and motivation by working closely with the finance departments in Munich and Osijek. They are the ones that gave me a push in the right direction and had my back every step of the way. Educating myself was equally important – I’ve been reading, researching, and attending different webinars and seminars ever since I made the decision. I have also attended a sales academy and my plan for the future is to finish an additional controlling specific course. 


Two years in, would you say that this was a good decision? 
  * Probably one of the best decisions I made since starting my career. Sure, there were ups and downs and days when I couldn’t say I knew what I was doing. But in the end, I wouldn’t change a single thing about it – this was my journey and I’m very proud of it.


### Are you thinking about a career switch too? 
What would you advise to someone who wants to make a career switch? 
  1. If you want something, don’t think it’s going to happen overnight – good preparation is half the battle. Explore all possibilities, educate yourself about the idea and create a plan if necessary on how you’ll turn the idea into reality. Sometimes it’s better to take smaller steps than to jump straight into something. 
  2. If you’re scared, that’s not necessarily a bad feeling. It means you care.
  3. Never doubt yourself, or your decision. Forget about that voice in your head that says “You can’t do it”. The truth is you can – you just need to be persistent and stand your ground. 
  4. Making mistakes is how you learn, don’t worry about it so much. 
  5. Surround yourself with people who have more knowledge and experience than you and learn from them. 


And that’s a wrap!

# How We Surprised Our Team With an Office Mural
Katarina
Marketing Lead
June 15th, early morning at our COBE Office. After a two-month lockdown, everyone’s back to work and in for a big surprise. The white canvas that's overlooking the whole office magically transformed into a colorful mural, expressing one of COBE’s main core values - teamwork. The idea for the mural came to us a few months back, but once everyone started to work from home, we decided to turn that idea into reality. The main goal was to finish it by the time quarantine was over. The four-week transformation consisted of drawing sketches on an iPad, transferring those sketches onto the canvas, mixing 50 shades of red, turquoise, and yellow, and then transferring those colors onto the canvas. But it all paid off in the end because our COBE vision came to life.
### How it all began
‘’Illustration allows you to create a world as the brand sees it”.
Before we start talking about the process, let's rewind a couple of months back. 
For those who don’t know, we work in an open spaceDarija, our UX/UI designer
### The process 
First, we sat down to discuss our brand, ideas, and everything we want the mural to portray. Then, we developed the story we want to tell. And honestly, Darija couldn’t be happier that one of her first projects for COBE, was to paint the biggest mural she had ever done
  * Having in mind that the illustration will portray the visual story of our brand and company culture, but also create a picture of the way COBE sees the world, I created three different interpretations to our story. With each interpretation, I tried to capture different aspects of COBE’s company culture. Then I translated those aspects into basic sketches and combined them with our color pallet (mixed with some soothing nature tones).


All three versions were so good we wanted to move to a bigger office where we could put them all up. But then we started thinking rationally again and decided on the playful **Teamwork** scene. At least for now. 😅
As being a team player is one of our core values, it seemed like the most logical option to go with:
  * Following our recently developed visual style, the illustration contained six characters. Each character was provided with a small glance of personality that caught my eye from our team. From fun and playful to dedicated and focused moments, I combined it all in one scene that tells the story of COBE.

Darija and the Canvas
After figuring out every little detail, Darija could finally start the magical process of painting the mural:
  * Since I’m pretty much old school and like to do everything by hand, the first thing I did is I measured and created a base grid on the canvas. That helped me a lot since the canvas is giant and I’m one tiny artist 🧚‍♀️. Next was the long, long process of transferring the sketch onto the canvas - of course by hand, following the grid. This was the part of the process when I was able to add a sparkle of details 🧙‍♀️ to the illustration. After the sketch was all set up, began the most fun part of the process - bringing life to the illustration, a.k.a. adding color. Picture yourself 50 shades of turquoise, red, yellow, a magic wand in my hand, music playing in the background, and just me on a ladder. Ahh, fun times!


Or just take a look at the pics: 
A creative mess by Darija
There were quiet, relaxing days, listening to Black Pumas, singing and painting, as well as some more adventurous ones:
  * Imagine me, at 150 cm tall, trying to reach the corner of a 250x580 cm canvas. Luckily, everything worked out great in the end. Not one leg was broken that whole time. **#Success**

*Not exaggeratingtiny artist*
### The Big Reveal
Only a few of us were involved in the process of creating the mural, so you can imagine how everyone else reacted when they got back to the office. But honestly, seeing the mural in person for the first time felt like a big surprise for us too. It’s one thing to see it on your MacBook, and a whole other to see it in person: 
  * Everything paid off when I saw my team’s reactions and how much they love the mural. I already loved our office, but now, I feel it brings even more personality to it and it definitely lights up the room! 


Even video calls with partners and clients are different now, everyone's instant reaction is “Wow”. Plus, the mural is a great icebreaker when pitching new projects. First we talk art, then we talk business. 😎 
Seeing how happy the mural made our team, inspired us for even bigger things. But more on that later. Stay tuned.

# Introduction to Inclusive UX/UI Design
Ena
UX/UI Designer
Have you ever broken your arm as a kid? I know it's not exactly a fond memory, and luckily, it's not something adults go through often, but picture this: your friend just broke their arm and suddenly can't use their phone like they used to. Instead of typing, they would have to rely on voice messages to communicate.
This scenario perfectly highlights why inclusive UX/UI design is so important. It's not just about meeting accessibility standards but about creating experiences that provide a diverse range of users with varying needs and abilities. This means ensuring everyone, regardless of their capabilities, can interact with digital products seamlessly.
### Get to know the user’s background
There are no two completely identical users, and inclusive design takes this into account by avoiding designs intended just for one group of users. However, some users can still feel excluded and marginalized by different factors. Here are the most common ones:
  1. Age 
  2. Sex, gender, and sexuality 
  3. Ethnicity 
  4. Socioeconomic situation 
  5. Disabilities
     * Visual: 
     * Hearing:
     * Motor: 
     * Cognitive
     * Vestibular: 


### Now, what’s inclusive design exactly? 
Inclusive design isn't just a nice-to-have feature but an essential part of UX/UI design. It involves designing with empathy and respect for diverse usersa deep understanding of their backgrounds and abilities
Many countries have established laws and regulations to ensure digital accessibility to reinforce these principles. One of them is the European Accessibility ActJune 28, 2025
Now, let's clear up the difference between accessibility and inclusive design. These terms are often used interchangeably, however, they are related concepts, not the same. Accessibility**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines** — to set a common standard and make web content more accessible for all users. On the other hand, inclusive design emphasizes the approach, not just the outcome. It’s a process of creating experiences that can be used by a broad, diverse group of users, and it starts by identifying situations where users are excluded from using the product.
### 3 key benefits of inclusive design
Inclusive design benefits all users, regardless of their abilities or background, but it also offers significant advantages for brands. Its importance can be considered from various perspectives, and I've pointed out three major benefits.
  1. Enhanced user experience: 


  1. Empathy and social responsibility: 
  2. ‍Expanded user base: 


### Don’t worry, there’s more!
Inclusive design ensures that everyone can use digital products, no matter their abilities or backgrounds, fostering a more effective and socially conscious user experience. 
Stay tuned for more on this topic, as we'll be sharing best practices for inclusive design soon. In the meantime, if you have any burning questions or want to discuss this topic further, feel free to reach out. 🚀

# Neuroscience and How to Design Brand Driven User Experience
Felix
Co-Founder & Managing Director
A call to create more meaningful relations between products and their users.
We live in a world of constant availability and endless opportunities to interact. Big news! We are aware of our attention constantly jumping from one notification to the next, from newsfeed updates to fake news, and sometimes if we are lucky, we even pay attention to real human interaction (cf. “closeness”, “empathy”, “real life”). Nowadays, the potential contact points between corporations and consumers are more diverse than ever and cutthroat competition to attract consumers’ attention is in full swing. The increasing overstimulation leads to a growing, more economic redistribution of our attention, especially regarding corporations and their brand messages. In the worst case scenario the “information overload” leads to inactivity, indifference and unreflecting consumption of data and goods. Alone the measures implemented by teams of psychologists and product managers for networks such as, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc. manage to get us “hooked” — to get us on a psychological hook in order to use their products as often as possible, that is.
We are increasingly overwhelmed. The ‘
Call me romantic, but I truly believe that designers of digital products have the power and thus should aim for creating real, meaningful relations between products and the people who use them. We need products that are of use to people, instead of products using people.

## User Experience is Brand Experience
The traditionally disposable form of one-way communication by brands and their messages has turned into a constant dialog via various forms of media. Brands are metamorphosing from rigid entities to 
A corporation’s digital products are a pivotal interaction pattern: User experience is brand experience.
The NielsenNorman Group has worded this precisely:
Nowadays, users expect their needs to be clearly understood and addressed at every potential contact point. To recognize digital products as brand messengers that intentionally trigger subconscious associations and emotions and not merely as information carriers, is a fundamental prerequisite in successfully gaining consumers’ attention.
In January 2017 the Apple App Store alone contained about 2.2 million different apps. This impressive number shows that the amount of apps a single person is actually able to use on a regular basis is rather limited. In May 2016 so-called zombie apps made up 90% of all apps in the Apple App Store; on at least one third of all available days these apps do not appear on any top list and can only be found when searching for the exact name of the app.
[High quality UI & UX Design](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services) is increasingly establishing itself as a ’hygiene factor’ whose absence predestines a digital product to be a zombie product. Besides a clearly formulated product strategy (virality, growth, etc.) brand-oriented design in particular can ensure long-term success and effective differentiation.

## Interfaces are Faces
When we interact with people we automatically try to categorize them and their meanings for us: Are they likeable, open-minded, introverted, clever, professional, trustworthy? We subconsciously judge appearance, gesture, facial expression and language and assess the consequences of this behavior so we can act accordingly. Interaction with interfaces follows the same rules. As soon as we use a digital product, we subconsciously read its appearance, its “behavior” and therefore its meaning, its story. What is this product, what is it able to do, what can it offer to me, how do I interact with it? Within a split second we decide whether a product is relevant and attractive for us or not.
Based loosely on an axiom of a communications psychologist Paul Watzlawicks: “One cannot not communicate”, I would state: products cannot not communicate. As soon as a company launches a product on the market it communicates on several levels and channels — whether it intends to or not.
Neuroscientific findings make it possible to translate abstract brand value into a specific design language. This is possible because the way we deal with products, and what this triggers in our brains, follows a certain set of rules. Brands and products send signals which we subconsciously decode. There is a certain connection between product characteristics and the mental level behind it. Depending on their physical characteristics (their digital representations respectively) and their behavior, we preferably choose products that address our goals and motives. This phenomenon is called conceptual consumption and it is a determining factor in our decision to either purchase products with soft sounding brand names, or prefer digital products with a cool, reduced color scheme and sharp, precise forms, or products that are easily controlled with a mere gesture of the index finger.
Every pixel, every animation and every interaction with the product has the potential to make the brand behind the product come alive. Colors, shapes, font, layout, movements, tonality, every element of an interface tells a story through its design.
Example 1 Example 2
The tonality of textual content — for instance the button title, toggles, or other UI elements — is another example for the subconscious perception of a digital product. The human and empathetic aspect of a brand is highlighted to a much larger extent in the phrase “I’m awake” (example 3) than in the significantly more prosaic and technical phrase “Course status: online” (example 4), for instance.
Example 3 Example 4
[User experience](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services) plays a significant role in the credible communication of a corporate identity. Every interaction with a digital product brings with it the chance to create an emotional and sustainable connection between the user and a product or its brand respectively.
Increasing digitalization and the “Internet of Things” leads to a gain in relevance for the [brand-driven UX design approach](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services/uxi-brand-experience-agency). The way the products communicate with us, the timing of it, the way we touch and use products, and the way we integrate them into our daily lives contribute significantly to our perception and categorization of a product’s character in our daily interaction with it. In the best case scenario, the character fulfills the expectations that have been created because of brand preference. For example: The character of a Bosch refrigerator has to be in sync with the brand Bosch: Its behavior towards the user is competent, precise and with a certain authority regarding food storage. However, a thermostat by the Nest brand behaves emphatic, modest and cordial, more like a family member.
## Conclusion
Every product has its own character which a user perceives on different levels. If this character is not clear and conclusive, the product’s chances of success are minimal. Appearance and behavior have to match the brand, the product has to fit in seamlessly with the user’s everyday life, enrich it accordingly and attend to their goals and motives with every interaction. Mental concepts can aid to translate brand values into specific design and interaction patterns. Whether an interconnected refrigerator or an intelligent thermostat ‘behave’ rather like a warm-hearted family member or a professional inventory manager, every contact point with these products has to follow a different script. A high quality, brand-oriented user experience can sustainably excite users about the product and the brand. It has the potential to build relations, trust and a loyal customer base and create something truly outstanding: A real emotional relation between user and product.

# No-Code vs. Custom Development: Why One Can’t Replace the Other
Antonio
Frontend Developer
For years, custom development has been the bread and butter of software solutions, offering complete control and flexibility. But lately, no-code platforms are changing the game, making it easier than ever for businesses to build applications quickly without writing a single line of code. 
With their speed, accessibility, and efficiency, no-code tools are gaining popularity for prototyping and creating websites. However, when it comes to scalabilitycomplex functionality deep system integrations
Understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach is crucial for making the right technology decisions. So, let’s take a closer look at how they compare.
### The power of no-code/low-code platforms
No-code and low-code platforms offer a fresh approach to building software. Previously, creating digital solutions required tech skills and a considerable investment. Today, these platforms remove many of those barriers, allowing people from different backgrounds to create digital tools and apps with ease. 
These tools often come with drag-and-drop features, pre-built templates, and simple interfaces that make development more accessible, so they basically help businesses automate processes and save time. Instead of writing complex code, teams can build automated workflows for HR onboarding, marketing campaigns, and customer service. 
Small and midsize businesses, in particular, benefit from these tools because they allow them to:
  * Automate tasks and simplify processes, reducing manual work
  * Test new ideas quickly and at a lower cost, helping your business to innovate faster
  * Build simple apps without hiring a full development team, making technology more accessible


For example, a marketing team can create a landing page in hours without needing a developer, sales teams can build custom CRM dashboards to track leads, and small businesses can automate internal operations like invoicing and employee scheduling, all without deep technical knowledge. 
Some of the most popular tools for this, which you’ve probably already heard of, are Webflow, Zapier, Notion, and Adalo.
If no-code development offers so much, why does custom development continue to play such a key role? Let’s see. 
### Recognizing the limitations
Despite their advantages, no-code platforms have some limitations that become more noticeable as a business grows. They usually struggle with: 
  * Handling complex data or operations that require advanced logic
  * Meeting strict security and compliance requirements, which can be a deal-breaker for industries like finance or healthcare
  * Scaling effectively without increased costs or performance issues, as many no-code platforms have usage limits


‍ What you want to avoid here is acknowledging these limitations too late, leading to costly and time-consuming migrations to more advanced solutions. Keep in mind that a system that works for 100 users won’t necessarily work for 1,000. Plus, most security settings are generic and may not meet industry standards. 
And let’s not forget about the limited customization options, too. This means your business could outgrow the platform’s capabilities faster than you expect. 
### When custom development is the right choice
Custom development remains the gold standard for those who require high-performance software solutions. It allows full control over features, security, data, and future updates. 
A developer can fine-tune every aspect of your app, from database configurations to intricate user authentication processes. This approach can enable your business to develop certain technological capabilities that could become significant competitive advantages. 
To sum it up, go with a custom solution when:
  * Your company has specific processes that out-of-the-box tools can't handle, requiring personalized software
  * Deep integrations with existing systems are required to ensure smooth operations
  * You need strong security measures in place, especially for handling sensitive data


Moreover, custom development provides a lot of flexibility for any future innovations. As business needs evolve, custom-built solutions can be easily modified, scaled, and adapted. 
This long-term adaptability often proves more cost-effective than the limitations produced by no-code platforms.
### The best of both worlds
Many find success by combining both approaches. You can, for example, rely on no-code tools for quick automation and early-stage development while using custom development for core functions that need more control and scalability.
This way, your company can:
  * Start with no-code for speed and convenience, allowing you to test ideas before making a big investment
  * Monitor performance and scalability over time, ensuring the technology keeps up with your business growth
  * Gradually introduce custom-built solutions as your needs evolve, maintaining flexibility


For example, if you're running a startup, you could use a no-code platform to quickly launch a prototype and test market demand. If your product gains traction, you can then invest in custom development to enhance functionality, improve performance, and ensure security. This approach helps reduce risk and make the most of your resources. 
When making this decision, it's crucial to carefully evaluate your specific needs. Consider factors such as budget, timeline, complexity, and the potential for long-term growth.
From a tech point of view, here are potential solutions for a hybrid approach:
  * Custom backend and no-code frontend
  * Custom core and no-code periphery
  * No-code for [MVP](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/use-cases/mvp-development)s
  * Internal no-code and external custom
  * Extending no-code with code:


### Planning for long-term success
Choosing between no-code and custom development isn’t a one-time decision. It requires ongoing evaluation and adjustments based on your business needs. [Companies that stay adaptable and align their technology](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/7-questions-you-should-ask-before-hiring-an-end-to-end-agency) with their goals will be better positioned for long-term success.
To make the right choice, consider:
  * The complexity of your software needs, as simple workflows may thrive on no-code, while complex ones require custom development
  * How much flexibility and customization do you need to avoid limitations down the road
  * Your long-term growth plans to ensure the technology you choose can scale with your company
  * Security and compliance considerations, which may require custom-built solutions


‍ No-code is great for speed and accessibility, while custom development ensures scalability and security. The right balance depends on the specific needs of your business and its future goals, of course. By regularly reassessing your approach, you can avoid expensive technology limitations and keep your operations running smoothly.
### The future of software development
The future isn’t about choosing one approach over the other; it's about being flexible. With advancements in AI, improved no-code tools, and greater system compatibility, now you have more options than ever. Many no-code platforms are already integrating AI-driven automation and expanding their capabilities to meet more complex business needs. 
Still unsure? Let’s take a look at some real-life examples of both approaches in action:
#### No-code
  * Dwellito
  * There’s a food delivery service called DoorDash


#### Custom development 
  * SonTek
  * GEFCO UK
  * A custom-built trading platform, capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, was developed for a financial services company


#### Hybrid approach
  * Zurich Insurance Group
  * EDP Renewables

‍
Technology isn’t just a support tool anymore; it’s a crucial part of your business strategy. If you treat your tech infrastructure as a dynamic, evolving system, you'll stay ahead of the competition. By regularly evaluating and adjusting your approach, you can create digital solutions that are efficient, scalable, and future-proof. 
For some businesses, one solution might be enough, but for many, combining different approaches is the key to success. If you’re not sure which direction to take, you can always reach out to us – we’ll find something that works for you. 
### What’s the conclusion?
Technology should accelerate your business vision, not constrain it. By making intelligent, forward-thinking choices in software development, you can create solutions that aren't just functional; they're transformative.

# Optimizing Digital Products: The Maximum Value Product Approach
Davor
Product Owner
Developing a software product comes with some challenges – defining the scope of the project given time and budgetary constraints is one of the most prominent. 
One way to approach this challenge is to initiate the project with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).Maximum Value Product (MxVP)
In this article, you'll discover how the MxVP approach can help you make a strategic shift by prioritizing value over the amount of work. 
> Finishing is torture... There's always some newly seen flaw. But the little glimpses of beauty between the anxiety make it worth it. 
### A Minimum Viable Product?
The MVP concept is a development strategy that involves creating a basic version of a product.early customers and gather feedbackvalidated in production
This concept becomes clear when the company developing the product is also the one running it. In such cases, the company conducts its market research, validates the concept, and, within that process, develops the MVP in-house. Usually, this means the company has a comprehensive understanding of budgeting, and creating the MVP is seen as an internal investment rather than an external expense
In short, the MVP concept works particularly well when the product vision is internally led and the product is developed in-house. But, what if the company decides to outsource an external agency
If that’s the case, the company will present a set of requirements to the software agency, expecting the agency to develop the digital product within specified time and budget constraints. However, in such a situation, if the agency suggests the concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), it can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. On one hand, as we already mentioned, it might seem like the agency is subtracting from the client's original idea by proposing an MVP. On the other hand, the oversaturated market may not be willing to use the product enough to provide sufficient data to validate it. Another drawback of the MVP concept is that it involves testing the product's value with real customers during production, often putting user experience improvements on hold for the future.
So, how can we ensure a mutual understandingconfidence
In the next chapter we will consider changing the strategy resonate with the client which features will provide the most value
### The Concept of Maximum Value Product
Maximum Value Product maximum value possiblewithin the given constraints
The concept of a Maximum Value Product proposes putting upfront efforts to find the most important problems the product should solve
In short, the MxVP concept focuses on features that deliver optimal value
### How does the MxVP approach work in practice?
In practice, implementing the MxVP approach can look something like this:
  1. Defining the most important problemsthe product should solve 
  2. Building a prototypefocused on solving those problemsproduct discovery
  3. Validating the concept with the users.
  4. Based on validation, prioritizing those features that bring the most value. 
  5. Working with the team on estimating efforts
  6. Presenting the solution as a Maximum Value Product


Applying the MxVP strategy gives the agency some leverage to tackle the most important challenges :
  1. To discover the most important features  before any development starts.
  2. To define a scope that makes sense for the client 
  3. To have the confidence that the scope is feasible to develop within the time and budget constraints


### Benefits of the MxVP approach for the client
Even though software agencies usually charge their working hours or person-days, the true measure of a reputable agency lies in their dedication to the value they deliver. Rather than fixating on output and tasks, a distinguished software agency stands out by focusing on maximizing the outcome, and the actual value the product they build creates.
In sum, the MxVP approach helps the clients and end users with the following:
  * Scope Definition


  * Feature Prioritization


  * User Expectations


  * Market Readiness


### What are your experiences?

# Panda CSS: Revolutionizing CSS-In-JS Libraries
Ivan
Frontend Development Lead
With the introduction of Next.js’ app router, writing CSS-in-JS in Next.js apps poses a challenge. Popular CSS-in-JS libraries, like Emotion or Styled Components, currently don’t support React Server Components (RSC). Searching for a solution similar to Emotion, I came across Panda, a new type-safe CSS-in-JS library with zero runtime, multi-variant support, and RSC compatibility. It integrates many beneficial features from other CSS libraries, wrapping them into a versatile package with numerous options and features. To me, it represents an evolution of CSS-in-JS libraries. But instead of just talking about it, let me give you a deeper dive into Panda.
### What is Panda, exactly?
As mentioned earlier, Panda represents an evolution in the CSS-in-JS paradigm. I think it’s almost inaccurate to label it a CSS-in-JS library, given its lack of one of the key characteristics of such libraries: runtime compilation.
Unlike Emotion, Panda creates CSS files for the app during its build time. This is in utter contrast to Emotion, which creates styles during runtime in the browser. While this approach has benefits, it can also negatively impact performance and JS bundle size. Runtime compilation allows you to define your styles and alter them based on the state of your app and components.
Sadly, Panda doesn't support this, at least not as smoothly as other libraries. However, it's important to remember that everything involves trade-offs, and Panda is no exception.
Despite not supporting app-state-prop-style changes, Panda offers numerous other features and benefits that make up for its limitations. Let's now briefly examine some of these features to understand why Panda is worth exploring.
### JIT Compilation and Utility Classes
Panda draws inspiration from numerous other CSS libraries. A standout feature is its Just In Time (JIT) compilation, similar to Tailwind, which compiles only styles you are using and compiles them down into utility classes.
This offers a significant advantage: any repeated styles in your app won't bloat your stylesheet since they already exist and don't need to be created again. Like Tailwind, Panda only generates the styles you use (with some exceptions).
For instance, if you define a style for a div
```
< className={css({:'gray.500',:'white',:'8',:'lg',})}>
  Content in a Div
</>

```

Here’s what the resulting HTML looks like:
```
< class="""">Content in a Div</>

```

And this will be added to the CSS file:
```
.bg_gray\.500{background-color:var();}.text_white{color:var();}.p_8{padding:var();}.fs_lg{font-size:var();}
```

Later on, if you wish to use padding: '8'
Not only does Panda adopt this great functionality from Tailwind, but it also enhances it. Your JSX/HTML code won't be cluttered with utility classes; they will only appear in the generated code. This addresses a common complaint about Tailwind, and Panda seems to have found the solution!
However, looking at the code above, you might argue that this will clutter the HTML more than Tailwind and make the code difficult to read. Don’t worry – there are alternative ways of writing CSS in Panda. Let me introduce you to some.
### Writing Styles
By assigning styles to a variable, you can make the code mentioned above look like this:
```
const=css({:'gray.500',:'white',:'8',:'lg',})
```

Then, you simply call the styles
```
< className={}>Content in a Div</>

```

At COBE, we place the styles in a separate file called ComponentName.style.ts
Consider a simple Card component which looks like this:
```
constCard=()=>{return(<>< className="""">< src="""" alt="""" /></>< className="""">< className="""">Hello from COBE</>< className="""">
          Welcome to COBE - Creators Of Beautiful Experiences
        </></></>
  );};exportdefault;
```

Typically, we would add styles
```
import{}from""@/styled-system/css"";const=css({:'sm',:'8',:'gray.100',:'4','& .card-title':{:'1xl',:'bold',:'2',},'& .card-text':{:'sm',:'4',},})exportdefault;
```

Afterward, you can simply add the exported styles
```
importfrom""@/app/components/Card/Card.style"";constCard=()=>{return(< className={}>
    ...
    </>
  )}
```

The JSX code is now clean and devoid of extra styles, all while retaining the benefits of utility classes.
### Shorthand Properties
To fast-track your coding, for some CSS properties, you can use shorthands. Note that the CSS I wrote uses shorthand terms like mbmargin-bottombgbackgroundmaxWmax-width
Another neat feature is the way you can define pseudo props. Try this:
```
maxW:'sm',:'8',:'gray.100',:'4','&:hover':{:'gray.100',}
```

Panda offers an even simpler syntax:
```
_hover:{:'gray.100'}
```

You can find a 
### Template Literal Syntax
If you're not a fan of the object literal syntax, you can opt-in to write a template literal syntax, which allows you to write your CSS properties like normal CSS. Basically, something like this:
```
const=`
    max-width: {sm},
    margin-top: {8},
    background: {gray.100},
    padding: {4}
`

```

Note how I'm using predefined tokens in this code with curly braces. This is how you can access them when using template literals.
To enable template literals, you need to turn them on in the panda.config.ts
```
exportdefaultdefineConfig({...:'template-literal'})
```

Although it's great for writing standard CSS styles, I recommend sticking with object literals for improved code completion. Note that there are some 
### ""Styled Components""
Panda CSS offers another style writing method, which anyone familiar with Emotion or Styled Components will find quite intuitive.
For instance, with Emotion, you would typically write your styles like this:
```
importfrom'@emotion/styled'const=.div(({})=>{return{:500,:..,...}})
```

You can then use the CardStyledCard
```
import{}from'@/styled-system/jsx'const=styled('div',{:{:'sm',:'8',:'gray.100',:'4','& .card-title':{:'1xl',:'bold',:'2',},'& .card-text':{:'sm',:'4',},}})exportdefault;
```

Instead of writing the following in your component: 
```
< className={}> ... </>

```

You can go with:
```
importfrom""@/app/components/Card/Card.style"";constCard=()=>{return(<CardStyled>< className="""">< src="""" alt="""" /></>< className="""">< className="""">Hello from COBE</>< className="""">
          Welcome to COBE - Creators Of Beautiful Experiences
        </></></CardStyled>
  );};exportdefault;
```

To enable this feature, you need to set jsxFramework: ""react""panda.config.ts
Notice the basebase
### Variants… Well, Actually, Recipes
Panda features something called Recipes, which are essentially style variants. In the previous example, we defined a property of a Recipe called basevariantscompoundVariantsdefaultVariants
Variants provide flexibility in presenting your components. To add a variant to your Cardvariants
```
import{}from'@/styled-system/jsx'const=styled('div',{:{...},:{:{:{:'red.500',},:{:'yellow.500',},},:{:{'& .card-title':{:'sm',},},:{'& .card-title':{:'2xl',},},}}})exportdefault;
```

Now, you have backgroundtitle
```
<CardStyled background="""" title=""""> ... </CardStyled>

```

If you have many variants and want to set some of them as default, just use the defaultVariantsdefaultVariant
```
import{}from'@/styled-system/jsx'const=styled('div',{:{...},:{...},:{:'danger',:'large',}})exportdefault;
```

Then, you can remove the backgroundtitleCardStyled
Compound variants are used for adding additional styles to your components when specific conditions are met. For example, let's say that you want to add a border to your card when the backgroundtitle
```
import{}from'@/styled-system/jsx'const=styled('div',{:{...},:{...},:{...},:[{:'warning',:'small',:{:'2px solid black'},},]})exportdefault;
```

There's a lot more to explore about 
### Responsive Design
One more feature worth discussing is responsive design. Panda handles this aspect really well. For instance, if you want to have different fontSizebasemediumlarge
```
fontSize:{:12,:14,:16}
```

That's it. You simply define an object with breakpoint properties and add your values.
You can even use something like mdToXlmdlgxl
If you want to apply styling to just one breakpoint, you can use mdOnlymd
### Other features
While this article touches on some of Panda's features, there's much more to discover:
  * Cascade Layers
  * Merging styles
  * Conditional styles
  * Patterns
  * Theming
  * Utilities
  * Panda CLI


For even more insights, I recommend exploring 
I know that I mainly discuss using Panda in Next.js with an app router in this article; it's important to note that Panda is compatible with virtually all popular JS frameworks and build systems
### Why I don't consider Panda a ""real"" CSS-in-JS solution?
At the beginning of the article, I said that I don't view Panda as a typical CSS-in-JS solution, and now I'd like to elaborate on that.
Firstly, Panda doesn’t operate during runtime, a feature that distinguishes most CSS-in-JS frameworks. While enabling your CSS framework to do most of its work during runtime comes with drawbacks, like JavaScript bundle size and potential performance issues, it also brings a significant benefit – conditional styles that can depend on the component or even the app state. Unfortunately, Panda handles this aspect somewhat poorly due to its build-time CSS compilation.
For example, in Emotion, I can do something like this:
```
importfrom'@emotion/styled'const=.div(({,})=>{return{:500,:?..:..,...}})
```

Based on the parent component's state, I can simply pass an isDarkCardisDark
Unfortunately, Panda doesn't even offer the option to pass this prop. You would have to create an isDark
Another feature Panda lacks is easily defining custom transform functions, as illustrated in this example:
```
importfrom'@emotion/styled'importfrom'utilities/toRem'const=.div(({,})=>{return{:500,:toRem(20)...}})
```

In this case, the toRem
While there are 
All things considered, the numerous features Panda offers make these trade-offs worthwhile. Plus, if you correctly set up your system with tokens, themes, utilities, and variants, you might not even encounter these problems.
### Ecosystem
As you may know, Panda was created by the same team behind the popular Chakra UI framework. While there were rumors that it may adopt Panda in the future, this isn’t 
At the moment, the recommended way to use Panda, especially if you want to use prebuilt components, is to pair it with 
If you’re comfortable styling the components on your own, you can use Panda with Ark - at least until Chakra UI adopts Panda sometime in the future.
### Conclusion
Panda presents a unique approach to handling CSS, offering various features that can simplify your work. While it has some limitations compared to other CSS-in-JS solutions, especially in handling dynamic conditional styles, its benefits make the trade-offs well worth it.
Therefore, if you’re looking for a new styling system, I cannot recommend Panda enough. Give it a try, and let me know how it went.

# Taming File Storage on Android – Part 2
Luka
Mobile Developer 
Oh, you've already read part 1 of this post?! Great, let's continue then. If you haven't, I strongly recommend reading it before you proceed. 😊
## Working with media content
In the first part of this post, I talked about storing non-media files on both internal and external storage. Let me now show you how to work with media files from app-specificshared
### App-specific media
If you have to store some media files, but the files are meant for use only inside of your app, it’s probably best to store them to app-specific
You can obtain the pictures directory using the following code:
##### fun getPhotoDirFromAppStorage(dirName: String): File? { val file = File(context.getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES), dirName) if (!file.mkdirs()) { Log.e(""TEST"", ""Directory not created"") } return file }
When you’re accessing these directories, you must use constants provided by the API, like DIRECTORY_PICTURES in the example above. If you can't find a directory name defined in the API that suits your needs, you can pass null into getExternalFilesDir(). Passing null returns the root app-specific directory within external storage.
### Shared storage
Whenever you want your app’s data to be accessible to other apps, or you want the data to persist even after the app has been uninstalled, you should store it to a shared storage
Android provides two APIs for storing and accessing shareable data. MediaStore APIStorage Access Framework
## MediaStore API
What’s a MediaStore? According to documentation, MediaStore**ContentResolver** object. You can obtain its instance from your app's context.
MediaStore**MediaStore.**.
### Querying collections
For example, to interact with the images table you would do something like the following:
##### val projection = arrayOf( //you only want to retrieve _ID and DISPLAY_NAME columns MediaStore.Images.Media._ID, MediaStore.Images.Media.DISPLAY_NAME) context.contentResolver.query( uri, projection, null, null, null, null)?.use { cursor -> //cache column indices val idColumn = cursor.getColumnIndex(MediaStore.Images.Media._ID) val nameColumn = cursor.getColumnIndex(MediaStore.Images.Media.DISPLAY_NAME) //iterating over all of the found images while (cursor.moveToNext()) { val imageId = cursor.getString(idColumn) val imageName = cursor.getString(nameColumn) } }
Notice: When you are working with **Cursor** objects, don’t forget to close them. I’ve used Kotlin’s **use()** function to automatically close it after the code inside the block has been executed. Also, make sure to call query() method on a worker thread.
You can use the same code if you want to interact with video or audio files. All you have to do is change **MediaStore.Images** to **MediaStore.Video** or **MediaStore.Audio** , respectively.
The Media store also includes a collection called **MediaStore.Files**. What you will find in there depends on the version of Android you have. To be precise, if your app uses scoped storageyourscoped storage
On newer versions of Android (only Android 10 and higher), **MediaStore** API also provides you with **MediaStore.Downloads** table, where you can access downloaded files.
#### Creating a new file
If you want to create a new file and store it to one of the collections, you can easily do so using the MediaStore
##### fun createNewImageFile(): Uri? { val resolver = context.contentResolver // On API val imageCollection = MediaStore.Images.Media.getContentUri(MediaStore.VOLUME_EXTERNAL_PRIMARY) val newImageDetails = ContentValues().apply { put(MediaStore.Images.Media.DISPLAY_NAME, ""New image.jpg"") } //return Uri of newly created file return resolver.insert(imageCollection, newImageDetails) }
First, you obtain an instance of **ContentResolver** class. After that, you get **Uri** of a collection where you want to store the new file. To put the new file within the collection you create **ContentValues** object and call **put()** method on it, passing key-value pairs as arguments.
The last step is to call **insert()** method on the previously obtained **resolver** instance. **insert()** method returns newly created file's Uri
#### Deleting a file
I’m sure that you’ve noticed a pattern in the MediaStore
To delete a file you would use code similar to this:
fun deleteMediaFile(fileName: String) { val fileInfo = getFileInfoFromName(fileName) //this function returns Kotlin Pair
> First, you need to obtain an iduri**getFileInfoFromName()** function does. Just a hint, this is my helper function, it's not part of the official API. When you have the needed info, you can retrieve an instance of **ContentResolver** as before and call its delete() method
This method accepts three arguments:
  * Uri
  * WHERE**selection** - specify which rows are going to be deleted
  * Array**selection** parameter - provide id


#### Updating a file
Updating a file is done the same way, except you need to call **contentResolver.update()** method instead. There's one thing to note here, however.
If your app uses scoped storagedidn't
### Storage Access Framework
In previous chapters, I’ve mostly talked about working with media files by using MediaStoreStorage Access Framework
When you’re working with files by using this framework, you don’t need to request any system permissions because the user is involved in selecting the files or directories that your app can access. After the user has selected the file, your app gains read and write access to a URI representing the chosen file.
#### Opening a file
Opening a file using this framework is pretty straightforward. Here’s one example to demonstrate it:
##### private fun openFile() { val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT).apply { addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE) type = ""*/*"" } startActivityForResult(intent, OPEN_DOCUMENT) }
This code allows users to select any file from the system’s file picker app. Let’s break it down line by line. First, you create an intent with **ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT** action. Then, you set a MIME type that indicates which file types your app supports. In the code above I've used **_/_** , which means I want to show all files. If for example, you want to show only images, you use **images/*** , or for pdfs **application/pdf.** Besides the type, you should add a category for files. In this case, I chose **Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE**. This will show only files that can be opened with **ContentResolver.openFileDescriptor()** method. When you have prepared your intent, call **startActivityForResult()** and pass in the intent with a unique request code.
Try to run the app and check what happens. You should see a screen similar to this one:
###### System Picker UI
#### Creating a new file
The process of creating a new file is very similar to the one for opening. Use **ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT** action to create a new intent.
##### private fun createFile(name: String) { val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT).apply { addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE) type = ""application/pdf"" putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TITLE, name) } startActivityForResult(intent, CREATE_DOCUMENT) }
As with opening, you need to add a category.
In this case, it’s **Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE**. Then set the MIME type for the file you want to create. If you would like to add a title for a file, you can do so by using **Intent.EXTRA_TITLE** intent extra. One thing to note here is that this action cannot overwrite an existing file. In case you put the same name, the system appends a number at the end of the file name.
Try running the code. You should see something like this:
###### Creating a new file
#### Granting access to a directory
If for some reason, your app needs to get access to the contents of a directory, you can use **ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE** intent action. By using this, the user can grant your app access to the entire directory tree. Your app can then access any file in the directory and its subdirectories.
It's worth noting that your app doesn't have access to other apps' files outside of the user-selected directory.
#### Getting the result back
For each of these actions, you need to call **startActivityForResult()** passing in intent with the appropriate action. When the user has finished selecting the file or a directory, you will get the result in **onActivityResult()** callback. You get selected file's UriUri
I will explain this in more detail later, but before making any modifications to the file, you should check the value of **DocumentsContract.Document.COLUMN_FLAGS**. It indicates which operations on the given file are supported by the provider.
Here’s the code you can use to obtain the Uri
##### override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) { super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data) if (requestCode == OPEN_DOCUMENT && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) { data?.data?.let { uri -> //use this uri to make supported modifications to the file } } }
### Under the hood
Storage Access Framework
  * Documents providerDownloadsImagesVideos
  * Client app
  * Picker


Every app that wants to contribute their files to the system picker UI has to implement its own documents provider.
Now, to go back to the statement from the last chapter where I said that you need to check **DocumentsContract.Document.COLUMN_FLAGS** before trying to do any modifications to a file. When apps implement the provider, they can set different capabilities for each document with the aforementioned flags. For example, the provider can set **Document.FLAG_SUPPORTS_REMOVE** to indicate that you can delete this document.
### To conclude
File storage in Android is a broad topic for sure, and there are some things that couldn’t fit in these two posts. That's why I’ll put some additional resources 
1.
2.
3. 
It can be really hard to start working with file storage on Android. There are quite a few things to consider when doing any kind of file management. I encourage you to take these examples and write them yourself (don’t just copy-paste them). Also, run the app and see what’s happening. Once you try it out, it will become much more clear how this stuff works.
I hope this post was helpful. If you have any questions or suggestions for improvement, please let us know! 🤗

# Taming File Storage on Android — Part 1
Luka
Mobile Developer 
Welcome to the first part of a two-part series on working with file storage in Android! A vast majority of apps are doing some form of data management. Whether it’s just loading a profile image, sharing images or video/audio files through messaging or simply storing data. Working with files on Android can be daunting. Especially if you’re new to Android, or just haven’t worked with it in a while.
When it comes to saving data on Android, we can choose from a few options:
  * SharedPreferences 
  * Databases (Room)
  * File storage


If you are wondering which of these options is for you, there are four simple questions in the 
In this article though, I am going to focus on storing data to a disk using some of the APIs provided by Android.
Topics 
  * Categories of physical storage locations
  * Permissions and access to storage
  * Scoped storage
  * Working with media content
  * Working with documents and files ‍


### Internal storage vs external storage
Android system provides us with two types of physical storage locations: internal and external storage. The most significant difference between them is that the internal storage is smaller than external storage on most devices. Also, the external storage might not always be available, in contrast to internal, which is always available on all devices. The system creates an internal storage directory and names it with the app’s package name.
Keeping in mind that the internal storage is always available, this makes it a reliable place to store data that your app depends on. Furthermore, if you need to save sensitive data or data that only your app can have access to, go for the internal storage.
Two things are important
  * A user cannot access these files through the file manager
  * Files in this folder will be deleted when an app is uninstalled


To access and store data to app’s**File** API. I wrote a simple method just for an example:
##### fun writeToFile(fileName: String, contentToWrite: String) { val file = File(context.filesDir, fileName) file.writeText(contentToWrite) }
Alternatively, you can call **openFileOutput()** method to obtain an instance of **FileOutputStream** that can write to a file in the **filesDir** directory.
##### fun writeToFile(fileName : String, contentToWrite : String) { context.openFileOutput (fileName, Context.MODE_PRIVATE).use { it.write (contentToWrite.toByteArray( ) ) } }
You would read from a file in this directory in almost the same way. You can create a **File** and call **readText()** method or you can obtain an instance of **FileInputStream** by calling **openFileInput()**.
Here’s an example:
##### fun readFromFile(fileName: String): String { context.openFileInput(fileName).bufferedReader().useLines { it.fold("""") { some, text -> return ""$some \n$text"" } } return ""The file is empty!"" }
### Okay, but when should I use external storage?
Well, as I mentioned earlier, external storage is usually larger than internal storage. So, the first thing that comes to mind is to use it for storing larger files or apps. And that exactly is the most common usage of the external storage. Since internal storage has limited space for app-specific
Generally, data you save to this storage is persistent through app uninstallation. There is a case though, where files are going to be removed when an app is deleted. If you store app-specific**getExternalFilesDir()** , you will lose the files when the app is uninstalled, so be aware of that. Additionally, data stored in this directory can be accessed by other applications if they have appropriate permission.
### Caveats
When it comes to working with external storage, there are few things you should do before storing data there:
  * Verify that the storage is available — there are cases where are user can remove a physical volume where the external storage resides. You can check the volume’s state by invoking **Environment.getExternalStorageState()** method. It will return a string representing the state. For example, if the method returns **MEDIA_MOUNTED** you can safely read and write app-specific
  * Select which storage to use in case more of them exist — sometimes devices can have multiple physical volumes that could contain external storage. For example, a device can allocate a partition of its internal memory as external storage, but can also provide external storage on an SD card. There’s a handy method in **ContextCompat** class, called **getExternalFilesDirs()**. It returns an array of **File** 's whose first element is considered the primary external storage volume.


###  Storage permissions
Android defines two permissions related to storage: **READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** and **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE**. As you can see, permissions are only defined for accessing external storage. That means that every app, by default, has permissions to access its internal storage.
On the other hand, if your app has to access external storage, you are obliged to request permission for that. That means if you’re trying to access media on external storage by using MediaStore**READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** permission.
However, few exceptions to this rule exist:
  * When you are accessing app-specific
  * With scoped storage


You also don’t need any permissions if you’re trying to obtain any documents or other types of content when using Storage Access Framework
When defining permissions, you can set a condition to only apply it for some versions. For example:
In the example above I defined **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE** permission only for version 28 and below. This can come in handy in situations where apps running newer versions can work without permission, but apps on older versions will break without it.
### Introducing Scoped storage
Android is focusing on privacy more and more with every release. Application SandboxingScoped storage
From the official documentation:
More recent versions of Android rely more on a file’s purpose than its location for determining an app’s ability to access that file. This purpose-based storage model improves user privacy because apps are given access only to the areas of the device’s file system that they use.
#### Why Scoped storage?
Before Android 10, apps have private, app-specific
Let’s take an example with an app that needs to provide users with an ability to select a profile image. To allow the app to access images you need to ask for storage reading permission. Given the permission, your app can now access images but also all the other files within the shared storage. There is no need for your app to be able to see every file, only to allow the user to select an image. This is one of the main reasons scoped storage has been introduced.
### The changes
This means that apps that target Android 10 and higher are given scoped access to external storage, or scoped storageapp-specificStorage Access Framework
If your app is not ready to adopt scoped storage yet, you have two options to opt-out of using it:
  * You can set **targetSdkVersion** to target Android 9 or lower
  * If your app targets Android 10, you can set **requestLegacyExternalStorage** flag to true in **AndroidManifest.xml**. Keep in mind that this flag is removed in Android 11

# PWA vs. Native: Which Approach is Right for Your Project?
Damir
Backend Developer
We all use apps for different purposes – whether it’s to track a workout, catch up on YouTube videos, listen to our latest podcast, or shop online. It’s second nature at this point. But here’s something we don’t always consider: not all apps are built the same. You know the ones you can download from the App Store? Those are native apps. Then there are progressive web apps – or PWAs – that run directly in your browser, no install needed.
You’ve probably used both without giving it a second thought. However, there’s still some skepticism around PWAs. The upside? They’re continuously improving, thanks to ongoing support and updates from both Google and Apple for Android and iOS. At the same time, devices are becoming more powerful, making it easier to implement things like animations – features that were once difficult or even impossible to achieve with a PWA.
The real question is: What sets these two apart, and which one’s the right fit for your project? Keep reading to find out.
### PWA 101
PWAs are a modern take on web apps, developed to run smoothly right in your browser. They have a lot in common with traditional web apps, but there are a few important differences. For starters, they’re built with a mobile-first mindset, which means they’re optimized for a smooth experience on phones and tablets. That said, while PWAs are a strong alternative in many situations, they’re not a full replacement for native apps – at least not yet.
PWAs are primarily built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but they’re often developed with modern libraries or frameworks like React, Vue, or others.
### PWAs: The good and the not-so-good
There are a number of reasons to build and use PWAs, especially if you’re after a flexible and user-friendly solution. Here are the most important ones:
  * Local data storage: 
  * Payment convenience: 
  * SEO opportunities
  * Fast loading time:‍
  * Instant updates: ‍
  * Faster & cheaper development: 


So far, so good, right? While PWAs offer many perks for end users, there are still a few things to keep in mind. One of the biggest challenges is user expectation. People often assume that every product has a native app, and when they hear “PWA,” you might need to explain what that even means. And let’s be honest, saying “It’s a web app” doesn’t always feel as convincing as having a traditional
Discoverability is another challenge. PWAs don’t show up in app stores like Google Play or the App Store, so if someone’s used to finding apps that way, they might never come across yours.
Finally, PWAs don’t always have the same deep integration with hardware, so things like Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi controls, or even camera and mic access may not work as smoothly (or at all), depending on the platform. This could be a dealbreaker for some users.
### When to use PWAs?
Suppose your app already offers a solid web experience, and you’re looking to expand accessibility for mobile users without the commitment of developing a fully native app – a PWA is definitely a good choice for you. They’re especially handy for businesses that rely on repeat customers, like online retailers. With a PWA, users can add your app to their home screen for quick access, no download required. It’s simpler for them, and it keeps your brand just a tap away, encouraging return visits.

Fast-moving platforms like social media and news sites can also benefit from PWAs. Their quick load times help deliver a smooth, seamless experience – exactly what users expect when they’re scrolling, swiping, or staying up to date.
### What about native apps?
Unlike PWAs, native apps are built specifically for mobile devices, which means you need to create separate applications for both Android and iOS. Luckily, modern frameworks like FlutterReact Native
Still, there are important differences between Android and iOS that developers should keep in mind while building apps. A major one is how each platform handles local data storage
Traditionally, Android apps are built using Java or Kotlin, while iOS apps rely on Objective-C or Swift. Today, Flutter and React Native are among the most popular options for building cross-platform apps with a single codebase, making native development more accessible than ever.
### Native apps: The good and the not-so-good
While PWAs have their own set of advantages, native apps give you a smoother and more integrated experience. They offer:
  * Better experience:
  * Offline performance:
  * App store:
  * Access to features:


Before committing to a native approach, there are a few challenges to consider. First, native apps require users to download and install them. That also means every time you release new features or improvements, users need to update the app, unless the update is mandatory. The problem? Many users skip optional updates, which can leave them stuck on older versions without the latest functionality or fixes.
Another drawback is the cost of development. Since native apps, to an extent, need to be built separately for iOS and Android, you’re essentially managing two parallel projects. Even if you use a cross-platform framework like Flutter, certain features still need to be customized and optimized for each platform. On top of that, QA testing has to be done individually for both versions, which adds time and expense.
Monetization can also be an issue. On iOS, you're required to support Apple Pay for in-app payments, and Google enforces the same with Google Pay. If you'd prefer a different payment provider, your options are limited by platform rules.
### When to use native apps?
Native apps are often the best choice when your goal is to deliver a seamless user experience and make full use of device-specific features. They’re especially great for:
  * Gaming
  * Education apps
  * Productivity apps‍
  * Entertainment & streaming


‍
If your app needs to take full advantage of device features, speed, and a high-quality user experience, native development is often the best route to go. Some well-known apps like Duolingo, Netflix, and Twitch are using this approach.
### So, what’s the right choice for you?
There's no right or wrong answer to this question – it really depends on your goals and priorities. That said, here are a few key factors to help guide your decision:
  * Development cost: 
  * User experience:
  * Accessibility:‍
  * Maintenance: 


### Final thoughts
In the end, choosing between a PWA and a native app depends on your specific goals, budget, and the features your app requires. Consider whether you need full access to device hardware, offline functionality, or in-app payments – and how much you're willing to invest in platform-specific development.
PWAs continue to evolve, offering more flexibility and ease of deployment. However, native apps still lead when it comes to performance and deep integration. As Google and Apple continue shaping the mobile landscape with their own standards and restrictions, developers often have to adapt to each platform’s rules. So while PWAs are closing the gap, the decision ultimately comes down to [what works best for your users and your business](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/app-design-agency#App-Development).

# Stop Writing Interfaces and Repositories on Autopilot
David
Mobile Developer
Writing interfaces and repositories is considered a best practice in Android development, but it can backfire if you don't really need them.
### The problem
Let's say we need to create a screen where the user can see and edit their online profile. No caching, no tests. Sounds simple enough, let's start coding.
First, we need a way for our ViewModel to get the current profile data so that we can display it. We don't want it to know anything about how this is done, and we're using an architecture based on use cases, so we create a use case:
```
classGetProfile(privateval:){suspendoperatorfuninvoke():=.getProfile()}dataclassProfile(val:)
```

The use case needs to get this data from somewhere. ""Get data from somewhere"", you say? Sounds like we need a repository: 
```
interface{suspendfungetProfile():}classApiProfileRepository(privateval:):{overridesuspendfungetProfile():=.getProfile()}
```

The repository is defined by an interface. Its implementation gets the Profile entity from our API. The ViewModel knows nothing of the repository. The use case knows nothing of the API. Each of these layers can be independently changed as long as they preserve their public interfaces. All is well.
Now, let's edit the user's name. Once again, we create a use case: 
```
classEditName(privateval:){suspendoperatorfuninvoke(:):=.editName()}
```

The use case needs to perform this somehow. We already have a profile repository which is loosely defined as the place where profile operations occur, so let's add another method: 
```
interface{suspendfungetProfile():suspendfuneditName(:):}classApiProfileRepository(privateval:):{overridesuspendfungetProfile():=.getProfile()overridesuspendfuneditName(:):=.editName()}
```

The implementation just returns whether or not the API succeeded in editing the name. The layers are still cleanly separated and independent. Our use cases are ready to be used to implement the profile screen. What's the problem?
### Why the interface?
We will only get profile data from the API and we don't have any tests at the moment. This means that we will only have one implementation of ProfileRepository
```
classProfileRepository(privateval:){suspendfungetProfile():=.getProfile()suspendfuneditName(:):=.editName()}
```

By removing the interface and renaming the class, we have preserved abstraction and reduced complexity. The caller still doesn't know we're using an API. During maintenance, developers will be taken straight to the implementation, which saves time and energy. Besides, we can easily create an interface from a class' public methods when the need for testing or polymorphism arises.
#### Point #1
Don't write interfaces before you need to. Classes can abstract implementation details on their own.
### Why the repository?
Our repository is now simpler, but what is its purpose? It just delegates its operations to the API and hides it. Now, this does have its benefits. If something about the API changes, we can react to it in the repository and not touch the use cases. This is a clean approach, as the use case shouldn't know about low-level implementation details, like the network. However, with this example's requirements, I would argue it's better to bend clean architecture in favor of simplicity.
```
classGetProfile(privateval:){suspendoperatorfuninvoke():=.getProfile()}classEditName(privateval:){suspendoperatorfuninvoke(:):=.editName()}
```

Future developers now have one fewer abstraction layer to think about during maintenance. The API is still hidden from the presentation layer and it can be controlled from the use case. 
#### Point #2
Don't write repositories if they just delegate their calls to another class. Remove the middleman and use the class directly.
### When should I use interfaces, then?
Use them when you need multiple implementations behind the same interface. Let's say we need to get a user's GPS location. There are multiple ways to do this on Android: 
  1. Fused Location Provider for devices with Google Mobile Services
  2. Location Kit for devices with Huawei Mobile Services
  3. Location Manager for devices with neither


Then we could have something like this:
```
interface{suspendfungetCurrentLocation():}classGmsLocationProvider(...):{...}classHmsLocationProvider(...):{...}classLocationManagerLocationProvider(...):{...}
```

Now every class that needs to get the current location will use the LocationProvider
```
@Moduleclass{@ProvidesfunprovideLocationProvider():=when{hasGoogleMobileServices()->GmsLocationProvider()hasHuaweiMobileServices()->HmsLocationProvider()else->LocationManagerLocationProvider()}}
```

### And repositories?
Use them when you need to coordinate multiple data sources. Let's say we need to fetch a news feed and cache it for offline viewing. Then a repository is justified and we could have something like this:
```
classNewsFeedRepository(privateval:,privateval:){suspendfungetNewsFeed():?{.getNewsFeed()?.let{.insertOrUpdateNewsFeed()}return.getNewsFeed()}}
```

Now every class that needs to get a news feed will use the NewsFeedRepository
### Conclusion
Before you make an interface or a repository, think if they will be used for their actual purpose. If not, save yourself and your team the trouble and just exclude them. In other words, remember YAGNI and KISS those interfaces and repositories goodbye. 🙂

# Product Ownership — Rights and Wrongs
Josipa
Product Owner
Several years ago, I applied for a job as an Android developer at COBE, right before the job ad expired. The position was already taken but I was offered to work as the company’s first QA engineer. Soon, having a defense line became inevitable and we decided to grow our team — the second QA place was soon filled out by my best friend, and I was as happy as I could be. 
### From QA to PO
At that point, we thought that we were working by Scrum, except: we didn’t have a Product Owner, nor a Scrum Master and neither of the ceremonies except dailies that lasted for one hour. But we had iterations, which were, let’s say flexibly time-bounded, with crazy unrealistic deadlines cause it was believed to motivate. The Scrum we had was broken, and we thought introducing roles would fix it. It turned out that Android development was long behind me as I was given the role of a PO with an explanation “You already write all the cases to check, now just write it before it’s implemented.”
Spoiler alert — it didn’t work quite well.
###  Product Ownership — how NOT to
I struggled with the acceptance criteria.
I would specify the requirement by defining what should happen by tapping on a button, going to the background while the screen is loading and returning in less than 100 milliseconds, all the while having a crappy internet connection. Although it made sense to cover this case as a QA to make sure the app doesn’t crash, it was painfully obvious that the criteria was far from the useful guideline a PO would give to the team.
I struggled with prioritization.
Before, we would start with a registration requirement. Then go on with the forgotten password functionality (depending on the social flag), and editing the profile screen (including custom crop on profile picture). Finally, we would proceed to the feed implementation of items that can be added to the wish list after authentication.
You can see right away something’s wrong here. There’s no use of registration unless users gain some significant advantages by logging in, e.g. the ability to save the items they love for a later purchase.
### 12 projects later, it looks much different
Fast forward to today, the main focus is value 
Also, we figured out there’s a few things to be careful about:
  * what we communicate to users, through pure strings, crazy animations or even white-spaces
  * what we research about the market
  * what encourages users to start their journey, stay on track, to search for more or to even buy more


### Value is key
As mentioned in my [previous article](https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/almost-agile-fc9f48c2e013), we work by agile. And in agile, value is directly related to priority — most valuable goes first. So we start with the core, making sure we provide quality on a simple yet valuable flow and build just in time, exactly what we need to wrap it all up. Next, we release it as soon as possible, collect feedback and keep following the vision. The focus is on what really matters — results.
It’s a complicated process and to make it work, you’d need a winning combo — a perfect feature selection, a careful [UX/UI approach](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ui-ux-design-services), highest technical quality and QA validation until the products are bulletproof.
Sure, it’s not easy but it’s all possible through great teamwork.
### It takes a team to win
Even when things didn’t look so bright, my colleagues always gave me a reason to stay. We built trust brick by brick and that helped us through the tough times.
And trust doesn’t just fall from the sky, we gained it and now we own it. It took us a lot of compromises, lots of understanding but disagreements too, dozens of small victories, some broken words and all promises kept.
One thing that made us stand out in the crowd is — always caring full hearted. About the product, about each other, about the quality, scope, user experience or our culture.
‍
### Wrapping it all up
Want to hear a secret that will resolve all your PO problems? It’s 42
I know :). It’s all about the experience, good or bad, about getting smarter along the way, learning to focus on the right priorities, putting a lot of work into making things happen, and even being lucky enough to be able to show improvement. You see, every piece fits into the puzzle.
And no matter what you do, you should love it. It doesn’t make sense otherwise.
This is my story about getting it all together, from scratch, from the point I didn’t know the hell I was doing — to the point where there’s always room for dessert.
Everybody has their own problems and solutions, and I would love to hear about yours!

# Promoting Mental Health Awareness in the Workplace
Vanesa
UX/UI Designer
For most of us, work isn't a place where we just clock in and out; it's a huge part of our lives where we spend 40+ hours per week, earn our income, and socialize. If you're lucky and have a fulfilling job with supportive colleagues, work can really benefit your overall well-being.
However, for those not so fortunate, work can cause dissatisfaction, which is why it's so important to talk about mental health in the professional environment. Although we've all witnessed a growing awareness of mental health issues, especially in the past few years, it can still be challenging for people to get the help they need, often fearing stigma or judgment from their colleagues. 
Establishing a workplace culture where people feel comfortable being themselves can make it easier to discuss their concerns and reach out for help. This is where HR plays a crucial role.
### The Role of HR in Workplace Wellbeing
What would we do without our dear HR? They’re the heartbeat of any company, working behind the scenes to ensure a healthy and supportive work environment. Through their expertise, effective communication strategies, and tools, they're encouraging you to thrive and become the best version of yourself.
Now, let's meet our HR team at COBE, which works seamlessly across our two office locations. At the helm of our Osijek office is Ivan, the Head of HR, who works together with Sara, our HR Specialist. In Munich, we have Dominik, our HR Manager, supported by HR Assistant Julia, and Merle, an HR working student. 
Today, we talked with Sara and Dominik about fostering well-being at work. Can you both introduce yourselves and share a few details about your roles and responsibilities? When did you start working at COBE?
Sara: I joined COBE three and a half years ago as an HR Assistant in my final year of psychology studies. Over the years, my responsibilities have grown, and so has my role. Today, my focus is on our culture, employee retention, education, and, generally, making employees' work lives easier while growing and maintaining productivity. For me, that's the best part — helping employees bring out the best in them. 
Dominik: I've been the HR Manager and Chief Happiness Officer for over six years, and like Sara, I also started my career as a student. After getting to know COBE a bit, I was thrilled to take over the HR department in our Munich office and implement all HR processes and strategies. My role now also includes handling various human-centered workflows, such as recruitment, negotiation, on- and offboarding, creating and maintaining HR strategies for salary models, and mentoring. 
As someone who’s been a part of COBE for years, what would you say is the most important groundwork for a healthy organization? We've all seen some improvement in the way mental health is perceived today, but some research indicates that there's still a lot of stigma around it. What's your opinion on this, and do you believe prioritizing mental health in the workplace is crucial? 
Dominik: Well, this topic has been in my book for quite some time now. Recent surveys and articles showing an alarming increase in burnout and stress levels made it clear to us that we need to include topics like psychological safety in our daily business. That means ensuring a safe space where people can be themselves and speak their minds without fear of judgment. This groundwork is essential for improving the well-being of our team and is something that should be communicated by company representatives, like CEOs and team leads, to set an example. So, in my opinion, **a psychologically safe environment** is fundamental, and no mental health program can replace it.
Speaking of ensuring a safe space, can you tell me more about your role in providing a positive mental health atmosphere in the Osijek office, Sara? And what specific HR activities fall under it? 
Sara: My role is to form procedures that will allow employees to feel safe, avoid uncertainty, and know what is expected of them to grow and progress. Nurturing a **feedback culture** is definitely the most important part. Apart from regular tracking of everyone’s progress and satisfaction, each employee has monthly 1-on-1 sessions with their team lead, and every six months, we conduct the following:
  * Anonymous employee satisfaction survey
  * 360-degree feedback within project teams
  * Feedback conversation with HR and team lead
  * Follow-up process in which we handle unresolved issues (if there are any)


I believe that **open communication** and trust are the pillars of a great work environment. To achieve this, we start from the top management and extend the transparency to all levels. We also encourage everyone to be kind to each other and treat each other with respect. 
I couldn't agree with you more. When everyone knows what's happening within the team, it makes things less uncertain and stressful. Now, Dominik, what tools are you using to keep the transparency in the Munich office? 
Dominik:First, we've introduced a digital anonymous suggestion box, a platform where people can actively ask for help. We've also implemented some other communication formats where they can talk about their energy and stress levels every week. We're making sure everyone gets their fair share through:
  * Weekly randomized coffee talks (Slack integration )
  * Weekly voluntary checkout session
  * Project check-ins and retros
  * Monthly mentoring sessions with their team lead


### Other Factors for Improving Mental Health at a Workplace
Now, once we've established a solid foundation of transparency and open communication, what other factors do you think can make a difference when it comes to employees' mental health? 
Dominik: I believe **making mistakes** and learning from them is super important. We're only human, after all, and mistakes are just part of our personal growth. Another critical aspect is keeping a **good work-life balance**.
You know what they say, ""If you're not making mistakes, you're not trying hard enough!"" But on a serious note, mistakes are all part of the journey. When talking about good mental health, we can’t skip the importance of regular physical exercise, which can boost mood and energy levels and reduce stress. Considering that working in IT often lacks physical activity, how important is it to offer sports programs to employees? Can you share some examples?
Sara If your job requires you to sit at your desk for multiple working hours, it's important to incorporate as much physical activity as possible during the remaining hours of the day. At COBE Osijek, we provide our employees with a subscription to the MultiSport Card, with the company covering 50% of the costs. This monthly subscription allows users to access any sports facility in the MultiSport network, including gyms and pools. Additionally, when there’s interest, we also encourage and help in organizing group sports activities.
Dominik: We have developed a strategy called ""healthy body, healthy mind"" to promote overall wellness with a set of physical and mental activities. For example, we offer weekly yoga sessions led by our CEO and weekly meditation sessions led by a colleague. We provide fitness subventions through , ergonomy 3.0 (including adjustable desks, comfy chairs, second screens, flexible working hours, and workation), a variety of healthy snacks everyone can suit themselves, and optional walking meetings outdoors.
Speaking of staying active and healthy, can you discuss any mental health training or awareness programs COBE offers and how these programs contribute to a healthy work environment?
Sara: Well, as we all remember, 2020 was a year of tension and change for everyone, but for COBEes, it brought something good, too – greater mental health awareness. We figured that providing our employees paid sessions with a mental health expert would be a great benefit for them as individuals and professionals. That’s when we started working with an external, licensed **Gestalt psychotherapist**. For those who are interested, we offer **eight sessions** every year and it’s a safe space to talk about whatever holds significance for them.
Is there anything else you'd like to mention about keeping mental health in check at work – 
Sara:Yes, for example, **ambiance** and **workplace design** are more important for mental health than you might think. We prioritize creating a well-designed office space with as much natural light and plants as possible. If you've ever checked our social media posts, you may have noticed that our office spaces are warm and homey. Our goal is to keep a welcoming atmosphere but still have high functionality for both individual focus work and team meetings.
### Benefits of Prioritizing Employee Mental Health
We've covered all the factors that can affect mental well-being in the professional environment, but how exactly does mental health impact job performance? Taking care of employees' mental health is not just a matter of well-being; it's a strategic move that
Sara: Just as job satisfaction plays a huge role in our overall well-being, so does our well-being impact the company's performance. Taking care of employee's mental health can have various benefits for the company, such as:
  * **Improved productivity:** When employees are happy with their jobs and roles, they're more likely to be more motivated, engaged, and productive.
  * **Reduced turnover:** The more satisfied employees there are, the fewer resources the company has to spend on recruiting and training new employees. This means more development and education opportunities for current employees.
  * **Enhanced creativity:** Happiness and creativity go hand in hand. Happy employees are more likely to approach challenges with a positive mindset and think of fresh, innovative solutions.


### Conclusion
In today's fast-paced work environment, prioritizing mental health has never been more important. By promoting open communication and implementing supportive HR processes, companies can positively impact employee well-being and overall productivity. Remember, investing in mental health benefits individuals as well as contributes to a healthier and more successful company.

# The Benefits of Working as a Junior UX/UI Designer in a Digital Agency 
Elena
UX/UI Designer
UX/UI designers have the luxury of choosing the environment they want to work in – is it going to be an agency, startup, tech giant? Maybe they’re going to freelance? It’s really up to them. Because there are so many choices, sometimes it’s difficult to decide which of these environments will suit you, as a UX/UI designer, best. To narrow down your choices, I wrote this article as an introduction to the work of a digital agency, and how your role, as a junior designer, fits right in.
### Now, what does a UX/UI designer in a digital agency exactly do?
Before we get into this, keep in mind that every agency has its own way of working and I can only speak on the behalf of COBE, where I’ve been working for the last couple of months.
As a UX/UI designer, working in a digital agency means working with interesting clients, on various projects, for different industries. Sometimes you’ll work on several projects simultaneously, other times you’ll be booked for a long-term project and tackle that for a few months (or even years). If you’re wondering, there are benefits to working on long-term projects as much as for the short-term ones. It just depends on what you prefer. 
Another thing your job as a designer will include is communication. Prepare for workshops, presentations, daily and weekly meetings with your team and with the client, and much, much more. It may sound overwhelming, but trust me, it’s not. 
### And what about a Junior UX/UI designer? 
Now, if you don’t have any work experience, you might be wondering how and where to start. I was in your shoes not that long ago – I started my UX/UI journey a little over a year ago in a startup. A few months later I got a job here, in COBE and one thing I can with confidence tell you is that even though I’m here shorter, working in a digital agency brought me much more knowledge than I could’ve ever imagined. 
Of course, there were challenges – especially when you’re a junior UX/UI designer, it’s completely normal. But just know that if you work in a digital agency, one thing’s for sure – you can always rely on the support of your team. 
When you first start your job, you’ll probably be assigned a mentor – a senior designer that’ll introduce you to the project and guide you through everything you’ll do (hi Dražen 👋 ). As I mentioned earlier, other than designing screens for mobile and web applications, your job will include participating in lots of meetings – with clients, your team, project managers, developers, etc. That means a lot of communication, so if you’re a naturally shy person, or you feel like your English is not the greatest, this might present a challenge for you, at least in the beginning. But you will get a hang of it after a while, I have no doubt. 
After working on various projects and gaining a certain level of knowledge and confidence, you’ll reach a mid/senior level. That implies having more responsibilities than a junior designer, participating in the hiring process of new designers, and being a mentor, just like you had one in the beginning. Even though I can’t wait to achieve that level, I still have a couple of years ahead of me, so for now, it’s more like this:
### Let’s talk benefits
Every digital agency has its own rules, workflow, people, and set of benefits. As I mentioned earlier, my experience is based on COBE, but there are a few things I want you to pay attention to when choosing the agency you’ll work for.
#### ‍Choose an agency with great company culture
Let’s kick it off with one of the most important things you need to think about when choosing your next employer – culture. There are lots of different meanings of the word culture, but for me, it means people. And even though there are a lot of different individuals in COBE, they all strive for the same goal – to deliver the best product possible, that will represent not only themselves but the entire agency. They are open-minded and always ready to offer innovative solutions, advice, and any help you need. They’ll also get lunch and sit down for coffee (or beer after work) with you – and that’s what I love about the COBE culture. For a young UX/UI designer, having a culture like this helps to easily fit into an agency. 
You might ask yourself, does it get any better than this? Yes, it does – when you meet our design team. Eight extremely talented
Joining the design team at COBE, I also joined their monthly practices. One of them is Design weekly,Design chats
I think we need a new team picture
#### Find a team you can learn from
When you’re a junior designer, you know how important it is to have a team you can rely on. What if I told you that if you came to COBE, you wouldn't only have one design team to learn from but two? Yep, if you didn’t already know, we operate in two locations, Osijek and Munich. And guess what, our design team in Munich is just as talented as the one in Osijek. We often collaborate on projects, share knowledge and sometimes even visit each other’s offices. It’s nice to have the opportunity to visit Munich once in a while, right?
#### Choose the agency that chooses you 
You want to work for a company that wants to see you grow. Education is so important, and you never really stop learning, especially if you work in IT. Luckily, lots of agencies recognize that importance. At COBE, they provide all types of education, from books and lectures to courses and conferences. And they always encourage us to take advantage of everything they offer. That’s how it’s supposed to be, remember that.
#### Choose the agency that challenges you 
Whether it’s an internal or external project, you want it to be challenging and to teach you something. Every new project you encounter should bring a fresh start for you, teach you something, and introduce you to something new – whether it’s a new client, a different workflow, or a different team. 
For me, this is the biggest advantage of working at COBE as a UX/UI designer – the diversity of the projects. You can find everything, from the automotive to the beauty industry, and that’s the beauty
### What working in a digital agency taught me
To be completely honest with you, working at COBE has formed me into the UX/UI designer (and person) I am today. I know it may sound like a cliché, but it’s the truth. I gained a lot of knowledge about UX/UI and more importantly, I learned what teamwork, motivation, passion, and supporting each other means. So if you want to drill your UX/UI skills, gain a wide range of knowledge, and advance your career – a digital agency just might be the right fit for you. 
If you still have any questions, feel free to contact me. And if you’re a complete beginner in the world of UX/UI design, get in touch and we’ll send you our COBE starter kit

# Typescript: Tips and Tricks for Improving Your Coding skills [Part 2]
Mihael
Web Developer
Welcome to part two of the article, I hope you are ready for more coding tips. Today I will show you how to make types change depending on some conditional types and explain how to work with type unions to leverage things you can do with them.
### 1. Conditional types
Conditional types allow you, as their name implies, to conditionally determine which type should something be.
I will get to the example in just a bit, but let me first introduce you to the nevernever never**truthy**. If the compiler cannot ensure that the value is truthy,
##### type Truthy = T extends 0 | """" | false | null | undefined ? never : T; ‍ // Bonus: you can use generics in functions function takesInOnlyTruthy(input: Truthy) {} ‍ // Passes compilation // Bonus: most of the times, compiler can infer the “T”, like here // no need to write takesInOnlyTruthy('Foo bar') takesInOnlyTruthy(""Foo bar""); // Does not pass compilation takesInOnlyTruthy(undefined);
As you can see, it is easy to write conditional types. The syntax is like a ternary operator in regular Javascript. So what can we do in this example? If T is a falsy value (zero, empty string, falsenullundefinedneverT
So, if you try to run the code you will get a compilation error due to the second call of takesInOnlyTruthyTruthyneverundefined Argument of type 'undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.never neverneverundefined Truthy
#### 1.1 Conditionals as a return type
You can use conditionals to determine the return type of a function. The only downside is that you must use “as”stringstringundefined
##### // We use ""extends"""" here to constrain input to only strings and numbers, but we could omit that and allow any type as input function returnBackOnlyIfString( input: T ): T extends string ? string : undefined { if (typeof input === ""string"") { // Unfortunately, we must use ""as"" here return ""Foo bar"" as T extends string ? string : undefined; } // Here too return undefined as T extends string ? string : undefined; } const fizz = returnBackOnlyIfString(""Fizz buzz""); // typeof === 'string' const baz = returnBackOnlyIfString(5); // typeof === 'undefined'
#### 1.2 Conditionals for determining function arguments
You can also use conditionals to tell what function arguments are supposed to be. Let me show you an example if you want to create a function that takes two arguments. If the first argument is a stringnumberboolean
##### function withConditionalArguments( foo: T, bar: T extends string ? number : boolean ) {} // Passes compilation withConditionalArguments(""some string"", 123); // Also passes compilation withConditionalArguments(null, true); // Also passes compilation withConditionalArguments(123, true); // Won't compile withConditionalArguments(""some string"", true); // Also won't compile withConditionalArguments(123, 456);
#### 1.3 Use tuples to create optional arguments with conditionals
So, you can define what function arguments should be depending on just one type, but what if we want a different number of arguments (or maybe even a different order)? You can do that using tuples. For those who don't know, they're arrays with known sizes and contents.
It works because in Javascript you can access function arguments via the arguments
##### function c() { console.log(arguments); } c(1, 2, 3); // If you type this in console of browser it logs something like: “Arguments(3) [1, 2, 3, callee: ƒ, Symbol(Symbol.iterator): ƒ]”
Arguments are array-like objects, but most importantly, they implement an iterator. Therefore we can spread them directly inside a function and make an array out of them.
##### function c(...args) { console.log(args); } c(1, 2, 3); // If you this in console of browser it logs something like: “(3) [1, 2, 3]”
So how does this help us? As I said, tuples are like arrays, but they are arrays under all, considering that Typescript is doing extra checks. In the end, once transpired to plain Javascript, they are just the same old arrays.
With more “spread” magic, we can get function arguments as we like. For example, let’s write a function called “printinputnumbercasing“upperCase”, “lowerCase”, “default”input
##### function print(...[input, casing]: T extends string ? [T, 'upperCase' | 'lowerCase' | 'default'] : [T]) {} // Passes compilation print('Foo', 'upperCase') // Passes compilation print(123) // Does not pass compilation print('Foo') // Does not pass compilation print(123, 'upperCase')
It might look complicated but fear not, there is a simpler way to do this by using discriminating unions (it will be explained later in the article).
#### 1.4 Watchout - conditionals do the type distribution
What does Watchout mean? It means that if you define an array like this:
##### (A | B)[]
distribution converts them to this:
##### A[] | B[]
Why can this be dangerous? Look at this code sample:
#####  type Foo = { bars: string[] }; type Bar = { foos: string[] }; type Input = { data: T; } & (T extends Foo ? { caller: (input: T) => string[] } : { caller?: never }); const bar: Bar = { foos: [""something"", ""also something""] }; // This will pass compilation const x: Input = { data: bar, caller: (_) => [], };
Do you see the issue? No? Okay, let me help you. The goal here was to make sure that if the Foocaller BarBarcaller 
##### type Foo = { bars: string[] }; type Bar = { foos: string[] }; type Input = { data: T; // Next line is where changes happen } & ([T] extends [Foo] ? { caller: (input: T) => string[] } : { caller?: never }); const bar: Bar = { foos: [""something"", ""also something""] }; // This won’t compile now const x: Input = { data: bar, caller: (_) => [], }; 
### 2. Leveraging unions
#### 2.1 Other possible solutions
Remember how I earlier said that there is a simpler way to achieve different numbers (and types) of function arguments? Well, here it is. The idea is that you use Typescript unions to do that and the easiest way to understand it is by going back to the previous example. It was the one where we were building a function that prints input string numberupperCase”“lowerCase”default”string
##### function print( ...[input, casing]: [string, ""upperCase"" | ""lowerCase"" | ""default""] | [number] ) {} // Passes compilation print(""Foo"", ""upperCase""); // Passes compilation print(123); // Does not pass compilation print(""Foo""); // Does not pass compilation print(123, ""upperCase"");
It works because Typescript is smart enough to figure out that if the first argument is a stringstring, 'upperCase' | 'lowerCase' | 'default'[number]Watchout: just make sure to wrap union in brackets after &)
##### type User = { firstName: string; lastName: string; } & ( | { isFullMember: true; membershipType: string } | { isFullMember: false; isFullMembershipRequested: boolean } ); // Passes compilation const user: User = { firstName: ""John"", lastName: ""Doe"", isFullMember: true, membershipType: ""Platinum"", }; // Wont pass compilation const user2: User = { firstName: ""John"", lastName: ""Doe"", isFullMember: false, membershipType: ""Platinum"", // this field gives errors now }; // Passes compilation const user3: User = { firstName: ""John"", lastName: ""Doe"", isFullMember: false, isFullMembershipRequested: false, // but now this is ok };
Notice that sometimes when working with TSX (React) and using this in Props, membershipTypeisFullMemberfalseuser2never
##### type User = { firstName: string; lastName: string; } & ( | { isFullMember: true; membershipType: string; isFullMembershipRequested?: never; } | { isFullMember: false; isFullMembershipRequested: boolean; membershipType?: never; } );
#### 2.2 Leverage unions when using generics
You can use unions to “write out” some of the types. Take a look at this situation:
##### function takesInOnlynumbers(input: number[]) {} // Error: Type 'number | boolean | null | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number' takesInOnlynumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, null, undefined, false, 5].filter((x) => !!x));
We know that after filtering, the array will only have numbers, but Typescript does not. So how do we fix this? Well, we can use unions to do that. Let's just write the signature of the function:
##### function takesInOnlynumbers(input: number[]) {} function removeFalsy(input: (T | null | undefined | false | """" | 0)[]): T[] { return []; } // This will now pass compilation. takesInOnlynumbers(removeFalsy([1, 2, 3, 4, null, undefined, false, 5]));
We added a new function called removeFalsyT | null | undefined | false | ‘’ | 0  we can “write out” some types“okay, I do not know what exactly **T** is, but I do not want it to be **null | undefined | false | ‘’ | 0**. And by doing this we have “distanced” T TT[]
After that, we need to make this function work. Now, I’ll introduce you to the so-called type predicatesuser-defined type guards
##### interface User { name: string; } function isUser(input: any): input is User { return ""name"" in input; }
Now let’s use it in our function. Here is the full code:
##### function removeFalsy(input: (T | null | undefined | false | """" | 0)[]): T[] { return input.filter((x): x is T => !!x); } takesInOnlynumbers(removeFalsy([1, 2, 3, 4, null, undefined, false, 5]));
That’s it. There is your gotcha moment. If you do this, the compilation won’t pass.
##### const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, null, undefined, false, 5]; // This won’t pass compilation takesInOnlynumbers(removeFalsy(arr));
This happens because Typescript cannot ensure the type of array won’t change. We could also do this:
##### const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, null, undefined, false, 5]; arr.push(true); takesInOnlynumbers(removeFalsy(arr));
Since arrfalsebooleantrueremoveFalsyas const
##### const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, null, undefined, false, 5] as const; arr.push(true); // Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly [1, 2, 3, 4, null, undefined, false, 5]'. const obj = { foo: ""bar"", } as const; obj.foo = ""xyz""; // Cannot assign to 'foo' because it is a read-only property
Doing this would ensure the compiler that the array will stay the same as it is. But you will need to adjust removeFalsy
### And that’s a wrap!
I hope you learned something new. If you are still new to Typescript, I hope you master it soon and then come back to this article. Maybe you even get an epiphany -  “oh yes, that’s what that guy was talking about ''. Repetitio est mater studiorum.

# The Future of Mobility: ADAC’s Digital Innovations and AI-Driven Solutions
Verena
Marketing Manager
Digitalization is transforming the way we live, work, and travel. At the forefront of this change is ADAC, Europe's largest automobile club, leveraging new technologies to redefine the member experience.
In a recent episode of our podcast ADAC
### Your Travel Companions: ADAC’s Top Innovations
When it comes to summer road trips, a few digital tools can go a long way in making the whole experience smoother and safer. We asked Angermann about his travel essentials, and he gave us his insights into three ADAC apps that stand out from the crowd:
1: Roadside Assistance App
Experiencing a breakdown on the side of the road is always stressful, but ADAC’s roadside assistance app
2: Medical App
Health issues while traveling, especially abroad, can be a challenge. This is where the medical app
3: Drive App
Angermann described the drive app
### AppCore: The Foundation of ADAC's Digital Ecosystem
At the heart of ADAC’s digital ecosystem is AppCore
Bernd Angermann further explained:
Instead of developing three separate map modules for different apps, we create one and integrate it into all relevant apps.
This modular approach accelerates development, improves code quality, and allows teams to quickly implement updates without rebuilding entire apps. AppCore's scalability is fundamental to ADAC's ability to deliver reliable digital experiences. It not only saves time and resources but also ensures consistency in quality and user experience
### Overcoming Challenges: Accessibility and Beyond
We were curious to see how accessibility fits into ADAC's digital strategy. With the [upcoming European Accessibility Act](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/introduction-to-inclusive-ux-ui-design) (EAA), the topic is a growing priority. Digitalization comes with its challenges, and ADAC has been proactive in optimizing its applications to meet diverse user needs.
Angermann explained some of the progress they've made, including improving keyboard navigation, adjusting color contrasts, and increasing font sizes for readability. He shared an example: 
We adjusted a blue shade in collaboration with the brand management team to improve contrast for better readability.
These efforts reflect ADAC’s commitment to inclusivity, ensuring that all users can access their services effortlessly.
### Paving the Way: Success Stories & Future Innovations
One of ADAC’s standout successes is the roadside assistance app, which has earned an impressive 4.9-star rating
The app reassures users during stressful situations, but the real magic happens when our technicians provide excellent service, completing the experience.
We also discussed ADAC’s plans for the future, including their use of artificial intelligence.Smart Connect
### Empowering Teams: A Culture of Digital Transformation
ADAC’s digital evolution isn’t just about technology – there’s also a cultural shift. Through initiatives like the digital campus
Angermann highlighted the importance of collaboration, explaining that regular meetings are held between designers and the brand management team to align on corporate identity. This approach ensures that the brand's identity is consistently reflected in ADAC's digital products. We also discussed how the team's tight integration ensures that each app has a distinctly ""ADAC"" look and feel – consistent, trustworthy, and focused on delivering real value to members.
### Can Tradition Lead Digital Change?
ADAC proves that even a long-established institution can lead the way in digital transformation. By combining cutting-edge technologyhuman-centered approach

# Web Summit 2019 Summary - Was It Worth it?
Josipa
Product Owner
Web Summit is known as the best technology conference on the planet. Over 70 000 attendees gathered in one city, Lisbon, Portugal, to get the answer to the ever-going question — where to next? In this article, I’ll cover the most popular topics and talks at the conference that drew our attention. Stay tuned. 
### What everyone was talking about
#### Data
I would say that the biggest topic this year was — data. Whether it was about valuable information collection, responsibility in use cases, privacy, or scary misuses, Web Summit covered it all.
The discussion officially started with Ed Snowden’s talk at the opening night. He claims: “The most powerful institutions in society have become the least accountable”. 
Ed explained how surveillance programs run by the NSA tapped people’s communication and warned that the collection of data creates a system that makes the population vulnerable for the benefit of the privileged
Later on, numerous references to Snowden’s talk were made by different speakers. They either stood by the idea or offered a different perspective. One thing is for sure — he made a huge impact.
#### AI
As you could expect, AI got its own place on the popularity scale. Being such a wide area, and becoming more and more ubiquitous, I would say that half of the talks in some way related to it.
Toolkit for surviving the robot apocalypseRobosexualHigh-impact predictionsMachine learning will make marketing more human Digitalization requires new ways for cybersecurityFrom AI to multiverse Are the cars smart enoughhe whole human thing
As I’m particularly interested in AI, my biggest regret is that I couldn’t listen to all of them.
###  Top three talks 
#### How to create awe 
Mike McGee and Framestore focus on finding innovative creative solutions to support the storytelling. Over the years, they set new standards for visual effects in cinema.
McGee presented the behind the scenes footage and explained how he uses the most cutting-edge technology to help the best narrators in the world bring their visions to life. The whole process is risky as they are inventing technology along the way to come with more and more astonishing graphics.

Their path into CG started with BBC’s breakthrough movie Walking with dinosaurs
Guardians of the galaxyPokemon: Detective PikachuAvengers: Endgame, Spiderman, The King’s Man, Harry Potter, Fantastic beasts 
Mike showed how they enhance backlog sets to extend the streets, or even construct whole cities from scratch, modelling building by building to create vast urban landscapes.
When filming Gravity, they rendered over 2 000 models to make the ship interior and to position Sandra Bullock into the NASA spacecraft. In the space footage, the only thing that is real is Sandra’s face — everything else, including Sandra’s body, comes down to the modelled and animated CG objects.

As visual effects are not enough, they also pay a lot of attention to performance. When bringing objects to life, their secret is to get use of micro expressions. That way they can demonstrate all the little emotions that characters, such as Winnie the Pooh, can experience. It seems that for those guys, anything is possible.
#### ‍Dude, where's my flying car?
David Wallerstein is a chief exploration officer of Tencent. The title was somewhat confusing but when you hear the background of it, everything sits in its place.
What David is mostly concerned about are the side effects of overpopulation and how to solve that problem. Prediction is, that by 2050, there will be 10 billion people on Earth. He states the question — how do we prepare for a situation like that? 
When looking for answers, first he looked at the statistics. He noticed that 55% of humanity lives in cities, that roads are the single biggest infrastructure investment area on Earth and that 100 million cars are sold per year, of which less than 1% are electric.
To bring his thoughts to action, David established a collaboration with Daniel Wiegand, the aerospace engineer, co-founder of Lilium Aviation — and they really hit it off.
Long story short, in May of this year, Lilium made a full performance prototype of a flying car that takes off and lands vertically, uses green energy to run, is commission free, is silent, flies 300 km per hour, can fly 300 km on one charge and enables connectivity without restrictions. Another nice characteristic is affordability. And the most important thing, there is no reason to worry about the safety aspect, as flying cars go through the same evaluation standards as all commercial aircraft.
The icing on the cake is — by the year 2025, they promised their product will be up and ready in 2 or 3 cities, at the same price of a taxi. Well, I will hold them to their word.
#### Welcome to the future of mobile robots
Through his presentation, Marc Raibert, founder and CEO of Boston Dynamics, walks us by the timeline of robot engineering starting from today and shares his short and long term plans.
He explained how their focus is on the athletics AI — the kind of intelligence that handles basic activities like balance, walking or running, conserving energetic of motions and responding to live environment in real time when avoiding obstacles.
They use numerous of integrated modules (perception, actuation, dynamic control and more) to produce robots that act autonomously in real time, in a surrounding that is unpredictable.
Until a month ago, Boston dynamics started shipping their first commercial product — Spot. This robot can be used in construction work, for military needs, in industrial setups at dangerous tasks in human unapproachable spaces or in everyday life.
Spot was even brought to the stage to demonstrate some of his capabilities. It was quite exciting to see a dog-like-machine walking, running, dancing and performing.
One thing I found especially interesting: Spot is customizable! And this goes for the hardware accessories as well as for the 3rd party software solutions. In other words, we’re free to use their API to manage and control any kind of extensions that we’re able to integrate, and run the instructions through a mobile application we make.
In 2021, Boston Dynamics
The grand innovation comes in the long term plans with new robot currently in the prototype phase — Atlas. This guy will bring the highest level in performance that we were ever able to see. It will involve amazing learning optimization techniques for solving complex problems, and will be used mostly for research purposes.
If you would like to know more about Atlas, 
Even though I found Atlas intriguing, I fell in love with Spot first, so he didn’t really get a chance :).
### Would I visit it again?
Web Summit was for sure a great experience! However, it’s important to mention that it wasn’t just the talks that made it great, it was the whole package — visiting a new city, the great conference and of course, my amazing COBE girls. 
When it comes to the conference itself, although they say it’s the best ever, I would not necessarily agree with that. It’s really overwhelming, as you could expect with 70 000 people in the same place at the same time (especially now, after 2020) when it’s your first time there and you don’t know the place or drill yet.
For the first day of the conference, I really did my homework. I spent a few hours looking for talks that were just-for-me, read all about the speakers and made a schedule so that everything fits. At least I thought so. I ended up running like crazy from one pavilion to another, trying to find the right stage. And when I found it, I often ended up standing somewhere in the back where I couldn’t hear a damn.
Next day I decided to play smarter, so I selected the talks by the stages and tried to fit as much as possible into the blocks. At some point I noticed that the central stage has pretty interesting speakers in general, so the last day I somehow stuck to it, which made me miss the talks I was interested in, but at least I heard quality speeches from different areas.
Sorry if it sounded like whining, because all in all I’m more than happy with the outcome. The organization was amazing, the volunteers put in a huge effort, there was food and coffee on every corner, the app was helpful, they gathered the most influential companies and speakers, organized workshops and debates and also insured the place for work when your job kicks in.
I wouldn’t say I learned something groundbreaking, however the conference was for sure a big inspiration and was highly entertaining. So if you have the opportunity to go, I'd say go! And don't forget to have fun along the way. :)

# The Cost of Assumptions: 7 Reasons Why You Can't Afford to Skip UX Research
Julia
UX Researcher
As a UX researcher with numerous projects under my belt, over the years I've witnessed the transformative power of UX research in sculpting product development firsthand. That being said, there’s still a stigma associated with the service, where some think of UX research as a nice-to-have, rather than a must-have. But, let me tell you – UX research is far from a mere luxury. It’s an investment that pays off in understanding user needs and preferences, which ultimately determines the success of a product.
Keep reading to find out why UX research is an irreplaceable aspect of creating successful products
### The Core of UX Research
At its essence, UX research aims to gain a deeper understanding of the product's target users and their interactions with it. Every product is designed with a specific audience in mind and the product’s success relies on meeting their needs, preferences, and ensuring they can use the product with ease. 
Through various research methods, like surveys, interviews, and observations, UX researchers gain insights into user behavior, pain points, needs, and motivations. This understanding sets the foundation for creating user-centric products and services that prioritize their needs – ultimately resulting in greater user satisfaction by addressing their genuine issues. Therefore, investing in UX research delivers a significant return on investment. How? You might ask. Let’s dive in and find out. 👇
### Avoiding Assumptions
One of the primary reasons a stakeholder should invest in UX research is to steer clear of developing a product based on assumptions
There have been times when a client would tell us they don’t need to conduct research because they know their customer
🔎 Example 1:
I remember planning a workshop where I had to set up a value proposition canvas to help kickstart a project. We filled out the product part quickly, but when it came to filling out the user part, we soon got lost in discussions. Why? Well, it turned out that all workshop participants had very different assumptions about their users’ needs, gains, and pains. The interesting part? Before this exercise, they weren't even aware of their different views.
Assumptions, while natural, need validation. UX research serves as this crucial check, ensuring that products align with actual user needs, thereby optimizing resource allocation and reducing costly errors.
‍
### Tailoring Products to User Needs
Tailoring products to user needs is a fundamental objective of UX research, while UX research is a critical tool for understanding the target audience's needs and pain points. By conducting in-depth investigations into user behavior, preferences, issues, and motivations, businesses can identify gaps in the market, discover unmet needs, and gain valuable insights into features that users value the most
🔎 Example 2:
By conducting UX research for one of our clients, we created an opportunity board that outlines their customers’ needs, assesses their fulfilments, and proposes ways to address them better. This approach helped illustrate the potential
This is just one example of how user feedback can empower a team to make informed decisions for the product. It allows them to create user-centric features, intuitive interfaces, and seamless user journeys that, in the end, form a delightful user experience.
### Minimizing Redesign and Development Costs
I understand that skipping UX research initially may seem like a cost-saving measure, but in the long run, it can lead to significant expenses. An early investment in UX research leads to identifying and resolving usability issues beforehand – this means a smoother development process and saving up on costly redesigns in the future. Usability testing
🔎 Example 3:
When designing a new website for one of our clients, we found out that customers had trouble interacting with the website’s navigation bar. Thanks to usability testing, we came across this insight and redesigned it, which, ultimately, led to enhancing the user experience. Conducting user testing during the initial stages of the project resulted in minimal expenses and no significant delays.
By addressing issues like this during the early stages 
‍
### Reducing the Risk of Product Failure
Understanding your target audience is key to avoiding product failure. If the product doesn’t resonate with users or doesn’t match their expectations, it can lead to significant financial losses and damage to a brand's reputation. UX research helps mitigate these risks by validating product ideas pre-launch. 
🔎 Example 4:
When discussing new product ideas with one of our clients, they expressed particular enthusiasm for an idea that they were eager to develop. Fortunately, they made the decision to first do the UX research to evaluate users' opinions on the feature. Why fortunately? Because the research showed that even though the users liked the idea, none of them would've actually used the new product, since it was missing a real use case. So, even though the idea was generally perceived well, proceeding with its development would have been a mistake. 
Good thing is that the research brought a bunch of insights to our client: they learned what aspects were perceived well about their idea, allowing them to incorporate these findings into another product idea that genuinely addresses users' concerns. This emphasizes the importance of engaging users in the initial stages of development
### Enhancing User Engagement and Retention
User engagement is a key metric for the success of any digital product, and to achieve this metric, it's essential to have a positive user experience. UX research plays a crucial role in improving user engagement by finding out what contributes to their positive user experiences. This empowers clients to create intuitive and enjoyable user experiences, encouraging them to stay engaged and keep coming back for more. Engaged users are more likely to remain loyal, refer others, and provide valuable feedback. This not only leads to increased customer retention
🔎 Example 5:
One of our clients uses a QR code on their product, allowing customers to register the product online. The intention behind this is to collect customer data and build stronger relationships. After conducting UX research for that same client, results showed that in 9 out of 10 cases, the installer of the appliance removes the QR code long before the customer has an opportunity to even interact with it. This creates an interruption in the customer journey
By diving into customer experiences and journeys, UX research unveils opportunities to enhance customer relations and measures to foster and achieve long-term customer loyalty.
‍
### Gaining a Competitive Edge
In today's highly competitive market, a superior user experience can be a key differentiator for businesses and set a product apart from the competition
🔎 Example 6:
After conducting in-depth interviews for one of our clients, based on the gained insights they came up with several ideas for innovative product features. However, they hesitated to invest in these ideas due to their newness to the market. Several years later, competitors introduced similar features to the market that then proved highly successful. To stay competitive, the client only then started developing their features. 
Had the client embraced these ideas during our initial research, they could have been market pioneers, enjoying a strong competitive edge. 
### Minimizing Support Inquiries and Simplifying Processes
Last but not least, UX research benefits the employees of the product-developing company as well, not only the users. It enables a detailed understanding of workflows and user journeys, along with information about what’s important at each step. This, in turn, helps simplifying the processes for both customers and employees, resulting in time and cost savings. Moreover, with the understanding gained through UX research, products and services can be designed to be more intuitive and user-friendly, reducinguser confusion and frustration
🔎 Example 7:
You can find another great example of the transformative power of UX research in our collaboration with a client in the B2B insurance sector. Faced with a product heavily dependent on manual processes, we initiated a comprehensive UX research to identify opportunities for digital transformation within these processes. 
As a result, we created a user experience that was both intuitive and easy to navigate for customers, and, accordingly, significantly reduced the volume of support inquiries. Thoughtful UX design offers multiple benefits – higher employee productivity and a better customer experience are just some of them. 
‍
### To conclude 
UX research is an integral part of the product development process, providing clients with essential insights about their target audience. While some think that there’s no need for UX research when you have analytics data, it’s important to notice that user interviews and usability testing offer unique advantages over analytics. Especially when it comes to understanding user behavior and the why
Other than that, usability testing allows us to observe users directly and identify issues and stumbling blocks that may not be obvious from analytics alone. By integrating analytics data and UX research, you can gain a holistic understanding of users that enables you to make informed decisions and develop products aligned with user needs and preferences. 
In today’s user-centric world, integrating UX research is essential for a product's success. So if you aim to build successful products and drive business growth, you know what to do next.

# Typescript: Tips and Tricks for Improving Your Coding Skills [Part 1]
Mihael
Web Developer
Do you want to improve your coding experience and understand Typescript on a deeper level? Yes? Then continue reading. In this article, I will introduce you to a collection of some less known and advanced tips, tricks, and possibilities of Typescript. But before I go on, let’s define Typescript first.
#### What is Typescript? 
In a nutshell, Typescript is Javascript with types. A more sophisticated description would be that it is an open-source language that builds on JavaScript by adding type definitions. Think of it as an advanced and upgraded JavaScript. But keep in mind, you do not have to use Typescript to its full extent - although I strongly suggest you do. 
Now that we have recalled the definition of Typescript, let's get down to business. I will explain utility and conditional types through examples and give you solutions for possible coding problems. If you have never worked with Typescript, please come back to this article if you ever decide to give it a try. 
### 1. You can index types and interfaces 
Don't miss out on this! Indexing interfaces/types is a very simple, yet useful feature. It allows you to select a type as you would select a property of an object. I'm sure you're already familiar with it, but in case you're not, I have to mention that knowledge of it will help you further down the line of this article.
Take a look at the following code:
##### interface User { name: string; lastName: string; dateOfBirth: { day: number; month: number; year: number; }; }
##### // This is valid code const someDateOfBirth: User[""dateOfBirth""] = { day: 2, month: 3, year: 4, };
The variable “someDateOfBirth” has a type that we took from the “User” interface.
### 2. Utility types 
On the official Typescript website, you can find a list full of utility types documentation pages. If you`re not familiar with them, I recommend you to read them. There are also some scenarios in this chapter on which I would like to focus.
#### 2.1 Pick - Take care of what you actually pick
The “Pick”
Here is an example from the “User”“name” “lastName”
##### interface User { name: string; lastName: string; height: number; email?: string; }
##### // This is valid code, a “picked” User const userWithFullNameOnly: Pick = { name: ""John"", lastName: ""Doe"", };
It looks all nice, but now imagine a function like this;
##### function mailToUserIfEmailExists(user: Pick) { if (user.email) { sendMail(user.email, `Hello ${name}, ......`); } }
If you take a look again at the interface, you will notice an issue - the “email”“?” “Pick”
So this code would do the job:
##### const forEmail: Pick = { name: ""John"", };
##### // This passes mailToUserIfEmailExists(forEmail);
The problem with this code is that we will never send this “John” user an email. Luckily, there is a way to fix this, so I will give you three possible solutions for this error: ‍
  1. Use “Required” undefined


##### function mailToUserIfEmailExists(user: Required>) { if (user.email) { sendMail(user.email, `Hello ${name}, ......`); } }
##### const forEmail: Pick = { name: ""John"", };
##### // This now does not pass, will throw error at build time mailToUserIfEmailExists(forEmail);
It will force you to make sure that the user has an email before passing it to the function. After that, you will need to remove the “if” check because now you know that the user.email will always be defined. When your function has a pattern like ""doSomethingIfOtherThing"", you should rethink your approach. I intentionally went with this example to show you that a condition like this would never be false.
‍
  1. You can use indexing I mentioned earlier - it will make the property required: 


##### function mailToUserIfEmailExists(user: { name: User[""name""]; email: User[""email""]; }) { if (user.email) { sendMail(user.email, `Hello ${name}, ......`); } }
##### const forEmail: Pick = { name: ""John"", };
##### // This now does not pass, will throw error at build time mailToUserIfEmailExists(forEmail);
Note this - unlike the “Required” approach, you can make it possible to pass a user with an undefined value. It will force you to have that property even though it is unspecified. Take a look at this code:
##### function mailToUserIfEmailExists(user: { name: User[""name""]; email: User[""email""]; }) { if (user.email) { sendMail(user.email, `Hello ${name}, ......`); } }
##### const forEmail: { name: User[""name""]; email: User[""email""] } = { name: ""John"", email: undefined, };
##### // This will pass even though email is undefined mailToUserIfEmailExists(forEmail);
  1. Shortcut for solutions 1 and 2


You can use this type to repeat the first solution (email can never be undefined
##### type PickRequire = Required>; // Your function would start like this then function mailToUserIfEmailExists(user: PickRequire);
Or you can use this code to repeat the second solution (email may be undefined, but you will further emphasize this) with less code repetition:
##### type PickRequireKeys = { [P in keyof Required>]: T[P]; }; // Your function would start like this then function mailToUserIfEmailExists(user: PickRequireKeys);
If you still have no idea what is going on here, don’t worry. Continue reading and I will explain everything later in the article. ‍
#### 2.2 Pick - When you pick, you do not have to pick everything
Let’s say you have this function:
##### function printUserFullName(user: Pick) { print(`${user.name} ${user.lastName}`); }
Here, you don't have to pass the picked object to the function if you want to call it. So, don't do this:
##### const user: User = { name: ""John"", lastName: ""Doe"", height: 175, email: ""john.doe@foo.bar.doe"", };
##### const pickedUser: Pick = { name: user.name, lastName: user.lastName, };
##### printUserFullName(pickedUser);
Instead, you can just pass in full user:
##### const user: User 
##### // Works fine printUserFullName(user);
This only works if you are supplying a “wider” interface than what is required, although even the “smaller” one doesn't have to be derived via “Pick”. But watch out! It will also work if you provide a completely different type, but “name” and “lastName” must match. 
So here is the complete code:
##### interface User { name: string; lastName: string; height: number; email?: string; }
##### interface ExternalUser { // This first two properties are same as on ""User"" name: string; lastName: string; company: string; position: string; }
##### const externalUser: ExternalUser = { name: ""John"", lastName: ""Doe"", company: ""Foo"", position: ""Bar"", };
##### // Works fine even though we picked from ""User"" printUserFullName(externalUser);
##### function printUserFullName(user: Pick) { print(`${user.name} ${user.lastName}`); }
Imagine a scenario where you don't want a function to do anything with ""externalUser"" - it would be better to avoid “Pick” and demand a full type. Although this is not an issue most of the time, it comes in handy.
#### 2.3 Record - watch out when using string | number | symbol
Record utility allows us to create an object with predefined keys and values. Check this out:
##### const productFriendlyNames: Record<""keyboard"" | ""mouse"", string> = { keyboard: ""Brand new keyboard"", mouse: ""XYZ Gaming mouse"", };
The issue appears when we use a “less specific” type for the keys (first parameter of Record“string”.
##### const functionsDictionary: Record void> = { foo: () => {}, };
##### // This passes compilation, will crash at run time functionsDictionary.bar();
An issue with this function is that functionsDictionary.bar
Okay, now what would be the solution here? Well, there are some advocates to make “Record” “Partial”“Partial”“Required”.maybe not set
##### const functionsDictionary: Partial void>> = { foo: () => {}, };
##### // This now won't pass compilation functionsDictionary.bar();
##### // We must write it like this now, this passes compilation and does not crash application at run time functionsDictionary.bar?.();
Note that you have a similar issue with arrays:
##### const arr: Array<() => void> = [];
##### // This passes compilation but will crash at run time arr[0]();
There is a long debate on this within the Typescript community if this should be the default behavior. One argument is that you should know the length of your array before indexing, but this is something I will leave for a future article.
#### 2.4 The third solution for the “Pick” problem
Okay, remember this code from a bit earlier?
##### type PickRequireKeys = { [P in keyof Required>]: T[P]; };
Here is a quick overview of things that are used for creating this type:
  * Generics
  * keyof
  * Mapped type
  * Utilities I mentioned above
  * Indexing (the first thing explained in this article)


Let's move on to explaining each one of the above-mentioned topics. I'll keep it short, promise. 
Generics
As the name suggests, they allow you to take a generic type and do something with it - the PickRequireRecord
##### type Maybe = T | null | undefined; // All three work const foo: Maybe = """"; const foo1: Maybe = null; const foo2: Maybe = undefined;
It is the equivalent to writing:
##### const foo: string | null | undefined 
for each of the foos
keyof
Very simple: it takes all keys of a given type:
##### interface Car { brand: string; color: string; } type CarKeys = keyof Car; // equal to: 'brand' | 'color'
Mapped type:
Simply said, “Mapped type” creates a type where both keys and values are predefined: 
##### type PriceMap = { [product: string]: number; }; const prices: PriceMap = { banana: 4, apple: 1, };
You may have noticed the in
##### [P in keyof Required>]
Essentially, what I am doing here is defining what the type of value each property PRequired>
Let me explain the solution as simple as possible. Firstly, I created a new type that takes an interface and keys you want to “pick” properties from. That type works by passing the interface through RequiredRequired>
###  Let’s take five 
I know it’s a lot of new information, so let's take a break here. So far, you have learned what Pick utility can do, how to fix the “Pick” problems, how to use the string | number | symbol in Record utility, and much more. In the second part of this article, I will show you how to make types change depending on some conditional types and explain how to work with type unions to leverage things you can do with them. Stay tuned. :)

# The Power Duo: Why Manual and Automated Testing Are Both Essential
Filip
QA Engineer
Testing is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle, and there's no question about the importance of testing a product before it goes live. However, sometimes you may wonder what the best testing approach is: manual or automated. Why not both? Talking from experience, using a combination of manual and automated testing has shown to be the most comprehensive and effective form of quality assurance. 
Keep reading to learn more about this powerful duo and how to make the most out of both. 
### Human Touch in QA: Manual Testing
When we think about manual testing, the first thing that comes to mind is browsing the app and navigating through its features. However, manual testing plays a much more significant role in software quality.
It brings a unique set of skills, intuition, and adaptability into a project that automated tools may struggle to replicate. It brings a human touch to the quality assurance process. Most importantly, without thorough manual testing and resolving all reported bugs, you can’t even begin with automated testing. 
The most common types of manual testing are:
  * Exploratory testing: 
  * Usability testing:
  * User-acceptance testing: 
  * Functional testing: 


Of course, there are many more types of testing that you can use, depending on the app and situation. In certain cases, what appears logical to automation tools may not align with the human perspective. That’s why it’s important to be creative and think outside the box in manual testing.
### Automated Testing
As apps grow in size and complexity, manual testing becomes more challenging, extensive, and time-consuming. Given these factors, there’s a higher chance of encountering errors that could potentially lead to the release of a production version with bugs. This is when automated testing comes into play. By incorporating automated testing into your project, you can ensure that any previously developed features are tested daily and work properly. 
The most common types of automated testing are:
  * Load testing: 
  * Stress testing
  * Regression testing: 


Nowadays, there are plenty of frameworks used for automated testing. For example, Playwright and Cypress are the most popular ones for web apps. For mobile apps, however, it’s Appium and Maestro.
In the end, you can't go wrong with whatever decision you make. The beginning might be a bit challenging, but there are plenty of online resources to provide you the initial support, so there's no need to stress over it. 
### Let’s Explore the Benefits
Every project will require different testing demands. So, before starting a project, make sure to define everything with the team: What type of app are you testing? Is it a web or mobile app? Which devices need to be covered?
It’s important to note that testing is very context-dependent. Depending on the application type, you might use a different approach, methodologies, techniques, and types of testing. For example, when working on a banking app, the QA engineer will have to think about all the crucial testing types that will be needed in the banking sector. In this scenario, it's crucial to test aspects like securityauthenticationerror handling
On the other hand, there are apps that don’t store as much personal data, like a weather app, which then leads to a different testing approach. Here, it’s crucial to test UI, location, and offline functionality.
Right now, you might be wondering: How do I know which approach to choose?
  1. Cost efficiency:
  2. Wide test coverage:
  3. Detecting [critical issues](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/prioritisation-in-quality-assurance-how-we-do-it) and bugs early in the development process:
  4. Being more flexible in an agile environment: 
  5. Validating complex scenarios: 
  6. Regular feedback:
  7. Confidence in the release: 


### Wrapping It Up 
To sum up, both manual and automated testing are essential for achieving the highest standards in software quality assurance. While manual testing offers a unique set of skills, intuition, and a human touch, automated testing provides efficiency and precision in the QA process, especially when the app’s complexity grows. 
Embracing both methodologies ensures a comprehensive approach to testing, mitigating the risks associated with human limitations, increasing productivity, satisfaction of end users, and better utilization of the QA budget. By recognizing the complementary strengths of manual and automated testing, you set the stage for projects to succeed in the dynamic software development environment.

# The Documentation Roadmap: Navigating the QA Process With Clarity
Katarina
Quality Assurance Lead
It's a common practice for people to document and write things down as part of their daily lives. Just think about all the times you created a grocery list before shopping or drafted a checklist before vacation, making sure you don’t forget anything. The same goes for QA Engineers – we write documentation to make sure nothing’s missing, but also to cover all crucial points of the product development. Let me explain it in more detail. 
Every project usually starts with an initial kick-off workshop to define the whole development process. During this phase, our focus, as QA Engineers, is on the QA aspect where we explain the various responsibilities we'll be in charge of. It’s important to mention that there are projects and cases where a QA Engineer won’t be available full-time – this usually leads to us switching focus to the most critical aspects of the project in order to meet quality requirements at a satisfactory level. However, this approach can sometimes result in skipping important phases of the QA process – such as writing documentation. In this blog post, I'll explain why excluding this phase is not recommended, and how writing documentation can benefit both the QA Engineers and the clients
### Why is writing documentation so important? 
There are many answers to this question, and I've highlighted the ones that are, in my opinion, the most important. So, without further ado, let’s dive right into the perks of writing and including QA documentation into a project.
#### 1. You’ll understand the product better
Drawing from my experience as a QA Engineer, I can confidently say that we possess a comprehensive knowledge of the product's functionality and behavior. When testing a product, QA Engineers will always put themselves in the shoes of an end user, which will lead to observations from a more critical perspective. It’s the QA Engineer who ultimately decides if a product meets the required quality standard for release. 
Just imagine what would happen if someone gave the green light for a release without knowing the product to its soul. Well, one thing’s for sure; there would be a higher risk of errors and users encountering significant problems faster. 
To avoid this, make sure to provide the QA Engineer with enough time to get familiar with the product, thoroughly review the requirements, and document them in the form of test documentation. 
#### 2. No important cases will be overlooked
You’ve probably heard the Latin phrase Verba volant, scripta manent 
To keep this from happening,
#### 3. You’ll reduce project costs and defect risks
If I ever decide to develop my own product, there are three things I'd expect from the agency I hired: high quality, low costs, and fast delivery.
To achieve high quality, it’s important to involve a QA Engineer in your project from the very beginning. They’re the ones who will typically review the project's requirements during the initial production phase. They are also the ones who will consider cases that may not be explicitly addressed in user stories, identifying issues that the rest of the team might have overlooked. Why is all of this important? Because this approach can result in cost savings for the client. Sounds good, right? 
The problem appears when a QA Engineer, due to the project’s complexity, doesn’t have enough resources for quality management. As a result, they often have to reduce their workload, which, unfortunately, mostly reflects in their test documentation writing efforts.
Writing test documentation brings many advantages – both to the client and the project team. So if a QA Engineer lacks the necessary time to go through the requirements list, there's a chance that some critical cases might slip through the cracks. When this happens, a bug might go unnoticed until a QA Engineer:
a) starts with testing, or
b) when the app is already live. 
To understand the whole picture, these are all the backward steps the project team would have to take in both of these cases:
  1. The client will have to inform the agency that there’s a new bug
  2. The client will need to re-hire a project team (if they stopped working on the project)
  3. The project team will have to analyze and understand the nature of the bug
  4. The project team will need to discuss how to fix the bug
  5. Then, the developers will have to fix the bug
  6. The QA Engineer will have to make sure that the bug is fixed
  7. The QA Engineer will ensure that fixing the bug hasn't led to any side effects on other connected features, verifying that they still meet the desired criteria
  8. Developers will have to push changes
  9. The client will need to approve the new product version
  10. The hotfix will be ready for release


That's 10 steps right there.☝️ If you take into account the time each of these steps requires, you might end up with an unhappy user sooner than you think – and they may even decide not to use your app ever again. Think about it; If a QA Engineer had more time to go over the requirements thoroughly and document these cases, this entire scenario could've been avoidedsignificantly reduce these risks
So next time you’re starting a new project, think of the QA Engineer as an additional team member who’ll prevent uncovered cases from sneaking in and contribute to cost control. 
#### 4. Regression testing will be more detailed and structured
If you're familiar with QA, then you’ve also probably heard of regression testing
> Regression testing means testing of a previously tested program, following modification to ensure that defects haven’t been introduced or uncovered in unchanged areas of the software, as a result of the changes made. It’s performed when the software or its environment is changed. - 
Without proper documentation, there's a chance that the QA Engineer will overlook some cases. This could increase the risk of running into significant challenges at inconvenient times, such as post-release.
#### 5. Better stability and overview of the product status
When building a complex product, there's always a higher risk that something could potentially go wrong. To avoid that, the QA Engineer should document and highlight all critical aspects of the product to ensure they're taken care of before each release. This proactive approach guarantees that, even when there isn't much time for regression testing, vital areas remain protected, enabling a seamless user experience. 
With proper test documentation, it’s much easier to track down the critical aspects of the app and manage quality assurance. Additionally, this approach naturally leads to higher test coverage, which, as you can probably guess, comes with its own set of advantages.
#### 6. You’ll find greater confidence in the product
> Quality means doing it right even when no one is looking. -
The work of a QA Engineer tends to be less visible than that of developers or designers. While designers create visible UX/UI design using tools like Figma, developers produce tangible app functionality through coding. For some clients, it might take time to see the concrete benefits of having a QA Engineer on the project.
Let’s face it, it’s human nature to make mistakes from time to time. However, in our development team, a QA Engineer’s job is to spot and catch those mistakes at the earliest stages possible. This typically involves discovering bugs in both the project requirements and the app itself, all the while enhancing its quality and guaranteeing that the entire process works as defined. In the end, this method leads to contented clients and end-users
Now, let’s explore a scenario where the QA Engineer is either not in the picture or lacks the necessary time for a thorough QA process. One, possible, outcome is a product with a lot of bugs – and not just minor ones, but major and critical ones as well. To learn more about bug prioritization, [read this blog post](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/prioritisation-in-quality-assurance-how-we-do-it). The aftermath? A rapid decline in trust, with clients beginning to question the team’s effectiveness. Meanwhile, the team itself grows frustration in light of negative feedback. This dynamic could make the collaboration difficult for both sides and to be completely honest – faced with these issues, the project’s success could be called into question as well. This is why having a QA Engineer on board of your next project is essential: it helps prevent mistrust and foster a connection based on mutual trust.
### The end 
And there you have it! I hope this blog post has shown you the true value of having a QA Engineer who can effectively write comprehensive test documentation. If you're not convinced just yet, my advice is to witness the benefits firsthand when you start your next project. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out directly. I’m here for you. 😊

# What Is DesignOps and Why Your Business Needs It
Amra
UX/UI Designer
In today's competitive market, a high-quality design is essential to make your product and brand stand out. But to make that happen, sometimes having talented designers is just not enough. You also need a solid team that works well together, clear processes, and predefined tools. The solution? Design Operations (DesignOps).
Often, the biggest challenge in product development is dealing with weak operations and disorganized processes. This is usually the case in larger projects with many roles, making it easier to lose control over things. Poor communication between different teams and departments can also be an issue. DesignOps brings structureorganization
So, if you want to improve your product and make your design process more straightforward, DesignOps might be that missing piece of the puzzle. Keep reading to learn what DesignOps is, why Design Systems require DesignOps, and how your business can benefit from it. 
### Understanding DesignOps
Before we dive into the benefits and reasons why your business might consider implementing this practice, let’s start from the beginning. 
DesignOpsDave Malouf
Instead of focusing on the end product, DesignOps focuses on the way that product is delivered. It's designed to improve processes, boost collaboration between teams, and essentially – make a designer's life easier. By standardizing design processes and tools, DesignOps helps designers face daily challenges easily and lets them focus more on what they do best – being creative and innovative. Plus, it ensures that everyone's on the same page with expectations, which, in the end, results in better cross-functional collaboration and improved organizational culture. 
To make it clearer, here’s a short breakdown of what DesignOps covers: 
  * Workflow
  * Work organization in and between teams
  * Tools, working methods, and processes


### What About Design Systems?
We can't talk about DesignOps without mentioning [Design Systems](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/design-systems). Although these two terms are related, they’re not the same thing. While DesignOps focuses on workflow, collaboration, and processes, Design Systems provide a designer with reusable components, guidelines, and best practices. These elements help teams maintain a cohesive visual and functional experience across all platforms and products, speeding up design and development and reducing mistakes.
It's important to note that you can set up DesignOps without a Design System, but not the other way around. Without DesignOps, due to poor communication and structure between teams, Design Systems can't be as effective and efficient as they should be. It provides clear roles and responsibilities within the team, helping to avoid unnecessary and excessive demands. This allows designers to focus on their work without worrying about management. The result is higher quality work and a happy, motivated team, which in turn creates the time and mental space for innovative thinking.
### Does Your Business Need DesignOps?
DesignOps can be great for your business, but before you start with this practice, there are a few things to keep in mind. 
The first thing you must know is that the implementation process differs for each company, depending on its size and culture. For smaller companies, it will require less effort, while it may take more time and patience for larger ones. The biggest challenge here is integrating DesignOps into existing processes, which is why you'll need someone in charge – whether it’s hiring a dedicated DesignOps Manager
For example, this person can be a Senior Designer with years of experience who wants to focus more on strategy. You can also consider someone who isn't strictly a designer but has a solid understanding of the design process and a talent for managing.
Once the stage is set, the DesignOps Manager will oversee the process, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Their focus on organization and support will ultimately lead to smoother operations and improved outcomes for the entire team.
Before heading to benefits, you can go over this checklist to identify which areas of your business might need improvements: 
  * Do you face obstacles in your projects due to inadequate tools or limited resources?
  * Do inconsistent practices cause varying design quality across projects?
  * Are your design projects often delayed because of unclear processes or communication issues?
  * Is your design team facing challenges in maintaining consistency throughout the design process?
  * Are your designers overwhelmed by interruptions from non-design tasks or other design duties?
  * Are your designers struggling to collaborate effectively with other teams and departments?


If your answer to all or most of the questions is yes, then you definitely need DesignOps! So it’s a good thing you’re here. 
### 4 Key Benefits of Implementing DesignOps
There are many benefits that DesignOps can bring to your business, but let’s wrap it up by highlighting the key ones:
#### 1. Cross-functional collaboration
First and most important – DesignOps facilitates better communication
By acting as a bridge between design and other business units, DesignOps aligns design efforts with business goals, ensuring more meaningful and impactful results. 
#### 2. Consistency and quality assurance 
As mentioned earlier, Design Systems need DesignOps to maximize their benefits. It includes achieving efficiency and consistency across visual and UX elements on different products and platforms.
Additionally, DesignOps establishes standardized processes and best practices, which helps maintain high-quality design
#### 3. Enhanced efficiency and productivity
DesignOps standardizes and optimizes design workflows
By managing tools, software, and resources effectively, DesignOps ensures that designers have everything they need to work efficiently, reducing downtime and improving productivity
#### 4. A healthier work environment 
This is something that's often overseen but is very important. DesignOps provides clear roles and responsibilities within the team, helping to avoid unnecessary and excessive demands. It cuts down on last-minute changes and missed deadlines, creating a more stable and positive work environment.
With well-defined processes and reduced administrative overhead, your team will experience less stress and frustration. They can concentrate on their core responsibilities without worrying about management, minimizing mental load and the risk of burnout. The result is higher quality work and a happy, motivated team, which creates the time and space for innovative thinking. And as a bonus, you’ll see less turnover.
### Ready to Give DesignOps a Try?
DesignOps is essential for keeping the smooth operation of modern businesses. This practice simplifies design processes, improves collaboration, and helps teams maximize their impact — even on tight budgets. Plus, it creates a positive work environment where designers feel supported and free to innovate.

# What Makes a Great Company Culture?
Katarina
Marketing Lead
Let’s have a look back at the last few years. Like most companies, we have also dealt with some ups and downs - from changing our management and having some people choosing different career paths, to growing our team to almost 50 people, and working on big projects with even bigger clients. Not to mention a pandemic that came knocking on all of our doors in 2020 and influenced our private and business lives in unimaginable ways.
A lot has changed for sure, but to be completely honest, we entered 2021 with some of the best results yet. And with the most satisfied employees - we’re not just saying that, we have proof! At the end of 2020, we received our second **Best employer award** given in the annual employee satisfaction survey by ""MojPosao"". Receiving this award means a lot, especially since a majority of things changed over the last couple of years, with quarantine especially. But seeing that our team still recognizes and appreciates all of our work, our colleagues, and our culture, keeps us going. 
Despite reaching a high level of satisfied employees and growing our team by almost a half in the last few years, retaining talent is still something everyone talks about and struggles with. Especially when it comes to the tech industry. Whenever you scroll through your LinkedIn page or attend an HR conference, there are two terms closely related to retaining talent that you will most definitely encounter - employer branding and company culture. What’s it all about?
### So, what is company culture?
For us, it’s all about working in a safe environment, being open, and having the ability to speak your mind, express your doubts, suggest something different, or try something new. That’s why we always encourage people to be as transparent as possible: 
  * People at COBE are both chill and professional. I think that’s what makes our company special. I was asked to single out the greatest day at work, but how can I do that when every day, for the past year that I work here, something interesting happens and every day I meet new challenges. But the thing I can single out, and the thing I’m proud of, is the teamwork we all put in every single day, which brings us some great business results, Goran


Other than that, company culture means valuing and respecting your colleagues, celebrating your team’s success, and never undermining each other:
  * The main reason why COBE is so great are definitely the people. It sounds shabby, but it's true. Although we are all completely different individuals, we are motivated by similar things. Just about everyone is team-oriented, ready to help out when needed but also contribute to an always great office atmosphere, Monika


‍
### Let’s talk about benefits baby
Company culture is notAnd that’s the main difference 
  * In order to come to work with a smile on your face, two things must coincide: you have to love the work you do and you have to be surrounded by good people. When those two things do coincide, you’re surprised at how quickly five years at the same company have passed. Your company is only as extraordinary as your people. For the last seven years, I have witnessed how much a small business can change and the only thing I can hope for is we don’t lose this feeling we have along the way, Mladen


So let’s redefine company culture once and for all in 2021. And I’m not only talking to recruiters now, I’m also talking to each and every one of you, because contrary to what some may think, company culture isn’t the job of an HR manager. It’s a product of common effort. From the management, all the way to developers, designers, and project managers. 
### 99 problems but company culture ain’t one
So, how can you know for sure that your company culture is great then? 
Most of the time you can’t, but our main tip is to talk. Talk to your employees and your colleagues, but not on a six-month basis; try to sit with them at least once a month and ask for their feedback, find out if something is bothering them, and listen to what they have to say. Other than that, motivate them - motivate your team towards success. Let them thrive. It’s a win-win situation. Happy employees, happy clients. No? :)

# The Impact of AI Technology on Design
Tim
Head of UX/UI
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly integrating into our daily activities, as I’m sure you noticed. But it’s important to note that it’s affecting not just individuals but businesses and employment opportunities as well. Over the last few years, the development of AI has moved incredibly fast, and experts believe that this is only the beginning.
To show how AI is reshaping our daily routines, I’ll start with the simplest example. During a recent conversation with a colleague, he told me he was looking for a bunk bed for his twins. After a quick browse, he found a website with AI-generated bunk bed images.

This scenario highlights how AI permeates our lives, even in seemingly mundane tasks like shopping for furniture. But (there’s always a but), while the ideas were innovative, one could immediately tell that they were flawed. So, while AI holds immense promise and innovation, it remains far from perfect (yet).
If you take a look at Moore's law curve, it's as if AI has rewritten the rules – rather than doubling every two years, AI model sizes increase more than ten times annually.
Source: 
What does this mean for us? Essentially, it means adapting to stay ahead or, at the very least, keep pace with the curve. Embracing new technologies and fresh ideas is crucial for thriving in tomorrow's economy – the era of the intelligence explosion is already underway. 
In the words of AI theorist, Roger Schank
> The AI revolution is doing to white-collar jobs what robotics did to blue-collar jobs.
### Where do we stand at the moment? 
I don't know about you, but lately, it feels like we’ve gone back to the early days of computing with command-line interfaces. However, today's version is far more sophisticated; we engage in conversations with our computers using everyday language, and we even receive responses. 
Even though AI has been present for some time – consider Netflix's personalized movie covers or Spotify's yearly recaps – with large language models (LLMs), it has risen to an entirely new level. These models don’t just follow commands anymore; instead, they use advanced algorithms to train large corpus of text to understand meaning and intention. Still, text-based, prompt-driven AI remains complex and needs a lot of cognitive load. Even in developed countries, almost half of the population has limited reading and writing capabilities. The question is, is prompt-driven AI the best way to interact with an interface? 
Fortunately, there are many AI tools nowadays that use interfaces designed to simplify your tasks, making it easier to achieve your goals. The days of tweaking prompts or images are over; now, users can seamlessly navigate through user-friendly interfaces in order to work with an LLM. So, next time you have a movie night, try MaimovieMaimovie 
### Use Cases
Still not sure how AI can benefit you across various domains? Let's delve into some use cases. 
Personal Productivity
  * AI co-pilots allow you to find, create, interpret, and interact with documents using simple language or easy-to-use interfaces. This can be very helpful in your overall workflow, for example in the sales process, writing requirements, or initial drafts. Additionally, they can support you in your private life as well – for example, when brainstorming gift ideas or planning weekend getaways. That’s always a nice-to-have option, isn’t it?


Data Analysis
  * In today's data-driven world, decision-makers are confronted with an immense amount of information. Luckily, LLMs offer the capability to navigate and extract insights from vast data points with more precision and speed. With LLMs, decision-makers can delve deep into complex datasets, uncovering hidden patterns, trends, and correlations that otherwise might have been overlooked.


UX/UI & Content Creation
  * LLMs and AI art generators enable automated planning, scheduling, and creating multi-modal content for social media, websites, and other channels. They can also give you a head start in familiarizing yourself with new topics, providing you with all relevant market and competitor data. And if you’re looking to speed up your existing workflow, they can support you in creating ideas and building your first draft within seconds, or even checking your design for accessibility flaws.


Development
  * Many no-code platforms are coming to the market, providing guidance and assistance throughout the development process. This allows individuals without prior coding experience to create simple websites using prompts. Of course, this doesn’t allow for complex solutions, but it can help build an easy landing page to test your ideas. On the other hand, when it comes to skilled developers, AI tools can help speed up their efficiency and eliminate repetitive tasks. A good example of this is the GitHub co-pilot or Builder.io. This is why it’s crucial to put plans into action now rather than just experimenting. The speed of AI adoption and integration gives businesses a short window of opportunity to create a competitive advantage. 


### AI in the Design Process
With this approach in mind, we looked at our design process at COBE to see how we can enhance it with AI. Additionally, we selected some tools that we think will significantly impact the future or ones that we already have at our disposal:
  1. AI in Research


  1. AI in Ideation


ThePOVPOV TextFXMiroMiro Assist.Add similar sticky notes,
  1. AI in Conception 


Creating initial wireframes has never been easier with the **Wireframe Designer** plugin for Figma. You can use it to quickly create initial concepts and wireframes, which can spark ideas for the final concept. Another Figma plugin I’d recommend is Attention Insight 
  1. AI in Design


We all know how much time sometimes goes into searching for the perfect picture for a presentation or a design. What if I told you you can create the perfect picture yourself using tools like **Dall-E** or **Midjourney**? 
Another new tool on the market is Creatie
On the other hand, if you’re looking for AI plugins to increase your productivity when designing, Figma offers many. Let me guide you through some: 
  * For creating landing pages from scratch, use the **Musho** plugin. It creates a landing page from square zero with real copy, images, buttons, etc. This can serve as a starting point for your design and a source of inspiration. 
  * Need some ideas for your copy? Try the **Magician** plugin. It allows you to quickly create copy for your concept or design. 
  * **Stark** is the go-to plugin for driving inclusion and accessibility. It’s great for finding accessibility flaws, such as insufficient contrast, and offering instant suggestions for improvements. 
  * And, of course, the **Background Remover** plugin! It can remove backgrounds from your images in just seconds. Remember how much time it used to take us in Photoshop to do that?


### AI Tools We Built
In one of our current projects, we've developed an AI Chat Assistant
Right now, we're working on a tool that helps identify and outline business model and digital innovation projects using simple, step-by-step questions with ChatGPT's assistance. Its purpose is to specify innovative ideas and to transfer them into actionable next steps.
### Conclusion
AI empowers us to be more efficient, more creative, more knowledgeable, more of everything. The rapid evolution of AI tools is evident, with new solutions emerging daily. Even as I write this, fresh tools are entering the market, contributing to the growth of ChatGPT's own App Store. Looking ahead, I'm excited to see the forthcoming AI features for Figma and other tools and am anticipating how they'll shape the future of design.
Lastly, it's important to remember that we can’t predict the future, but we can control how we respond to change – be curious, vigilant, proactive, and optimistic. By working with AI instead of being replaced by it, we can ensure that AI technology remains a tool for enhancing human well-being rather than threatening it.
Got any thoughts or questions? Feel free to reach out. 
A special thanks goes out to my colleague, Luis, who tried out all the plugins, thought about use cases to compare them, and put in a lot of passion researching and creating wireframes and designs. 🤝

# What Makes UX Inseparable from Brand Identity
Felix
Co-Founder & Managing Director
Let’s start with a loaded question: what is the role of brands in today’s digital world? With billions of products and offerings flashing at you from every screen around you, how do you stand out? How do you make people pay attention to your product?
A brand isn’t merely a set of colors or a specific design, it’s what’s happening in that interaction between you, the end user, and the product. How does it make you feel? Does it draw you in or push you away? What specifically prompts a reaction at all? And how does UX design come into this equation?
There’s a lot of questions here – let’s start answering them!
### What makes a brand stand out?
Oftentimes, when we think about brands, we tend to think about the latest trends. What do people currently like? What’s popular at the moment? If only we can replicate what people currently like, will that make people like our brand too?
Chasing trends doesn’t always give the wanted results – it just makes you drown in an already saturated crowd. Let’s take a step back and first think about the factors that help brands stand out:
  * Credibility“Can I trust you?”
  * Relevance“Why should I care?”‍
  * Differentiation“Why you and not someone else?”


One of my favorite examples at the moment is Duolingo, a language-learning app. You’ve likely heard of it, and for good reason. If you visit Duolingo’s website, their headline is: “The free, fun, and effective way to learn a language!”
How do they fulfill the expectations set by this promise? Duolingo has a very specific identity crafted around its titular owl character, Duo the Owl. It’s well known for its stylized depiction and aggressively threatening tone of reminding users not to miss their daily streaks, which has gained significant attention across popular culture and memes.

All these elements contribute to the three brand factors. Duolingo is credibledoesrelevantdifferentiates
Of course, there’s more to succeeding as a product beyond just having a well-thought out brand – but it’s a strong foundation for building other aspects of the product, including designing the user experience.
### Trusting a brand
Think of a brand as a person you enjoy spending time with. If a brand matches what the user expects emotionally, it’ll feel like time well spent. I want my bank provider to feel safe. I want my internet provider to feel efficient and fast. And I want my language learning app to be fun, educational, and entertaining at the same time. It’s kind of like that common adage – you may not remember exactly what someone had said, but you will remember how they made you feel.
When you launch a product or campaign, you’re sending a message. The clearer and more consistent that message is across channels, the stronger the brand image in users’ minds. In saturated markets, brand perception is often the key differentiator.
Consistency is the foundation that builds brand credibilitythis was time well spent
Integrating those ideas into the user experience is another area where you should strive to meet the users’ expectations. This is something that happens subconsciously – it’s kind of like speaking a language. If you’re using a vocabulary your audience doesn’t understand, your message will inevitably get lost.
And how to accomplish this? Allow me to introduce you to the UXi method.
### How UX helps communicate brand identity
UXi stands for [User Experience Identity](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/uxi-brand-experience-agency), and it’s a UX strategy where design decisions are no longer a matter of personal taste. From a UXi viewpoint, nothing you encounter on Duolingo is there just because it “felt right” – every feature is backed by clear logic and purpose, with each detail contributing to the greater whole.
“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder[neuroscience](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/neuroscience-and-how-to-design-brand-driven-user-experience), behavioral economics, and developed UXi
The COBE UXi evaluation determines the compatibility of a brand and the UX design of a finished digital product. To establish the perfect brand design fit, we conduct qualitative research with a specific target group. This verifies the brand quality and identifies the potential for optimisation.
Let’s take a real-world example. Let’s say you have a specific expectation for a brand, such as a car brand, and you want it to feel high-quality, to really give that edge of pleasure to the driving experience. That likely means you also expect to feel that way in every interaction with the brand beyond the car itself – you expect it when using their digital products.
Some UXi attributes for our [MPreis project](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/projects/mpreis) included fresh and open. 
Imagine that brand stands for dynamic
On the [FYEO project](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/projects/fyeo), making the motion just right was key to bringing the brand to life. 
When you define all these elements, you can reuse them everywhere. This goes beyond design, as it makes many aspects of creating your product easier, allowing you to bake your values into every step of the process. It’s much easier to get complete teams on board as there’s no discussion about taste, who likes what, or what’s currently trendy – every single decision is based on brand value
Our UXi strategy for [Porsche Holding](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/projects/carlog) focused on these core values: easy, high quality, and reliable.
The most valuable result of designing a product with this method in mind is the previously mentioned consistency[design systems](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/how-to-build-a-design-system)
On the other hand, inconsistencies in user experience can make it difficult for users to navigate your brand due to varying experiences. This can leave them feeling confused and perceive your brand as unprofessional, reducing the trustworthiness of your product or company. But if every aspect of your product is shaped by knowledge and understanding of what your brand is, then your audience will have an easier time understanding it as well.
### When UX speaks the language of your brand
In today’s hyper-connected digital world, brand identity isn’t just what you say about yourself – it’s what people experience when they interact with your product. A truly successful product doesn’t separate the brand from UX, it unites the two to reflect what the brand stands for at every touchpoint. Loyalty and trust is built when design choices intuitively match the brand’s promise and users feel that alignment.
This is why UX needs to be grounded in a deep understanding of your brand identity. With methods like UXi, we make that connection intentional, translating abstract values into concrete, usable design decisions that strengthen the brand in every interaction. Every audience wishes to be understood, and that understanding is made when UX and brand speak the same language.
If this feels right for you, don’t hesitate to [reach out](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/contact), and stay tuned for further articles where we’ll dive deeper into how we implement UXi in our projects.

# Why Accessibility is no Longer Optional: Preparing for the EAA
Vanesa
UX/UI Designer
Everyone talks about accessibility these days, and there's a good reason for it. With the European Accessibility Act (EAA) coming into play in the EU in June of this year, businesses will have to meet its requirements and follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). In this blog post, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about accessibility and share a few tips that will help you create a better experience for your end users. 
### Understanding accessibility
Let’s start with World Health Organization (WHO)
Disability stats from Germany. Source: 
Accessibility focuses on designing and developing digital products that are usable and accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities. It also helps businesses stay compliant with the law, reach more users, as well as build a better user experience and reputation. Ignoring it can lead to legal issues, exclusion of potential users, and damage to a company's reputation – and that's definitely something you want to avoid.
When accessibility becomes a key part of your company's values, it completely changes the way decisions are made. In one of our recent blog posts, we covered the key things you need to know about [inclusive design](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/introduction-to-inclusive-ux-ui-design), including different types of disabilities, so make sure you give it a read.
### Let’s talk about the EAA
There's something that will definitely turn things around and make accessibility a must-have; the upcoming EAA that will be enforced on June 28th in the European Union
The EAA will make life easier for at least 87 million people with disabilities, which is almost one in five Europeans. The new rules will facilitate people’s access to public transport, banking services, computers, TVs, e-books, online shops, and much more. The main goal of the EAA is to make sure everyone can fully participate in society. That includes those with permanent disabilities, as well as those with temporary disabilities, such as a broken arm.
Examples of permanent, temporary and situational disabilities. Source: 
The Act's common accessibility requirements are a win-win for both companies and customers. On one hand, companies will find it easier to trade with other EU countries and be confident that they can sell their products and services across the EU. On the other hand, customers will benefit, too, as the Act will drive more innovation, leading to a wider range of more inclusive options with more competitive prices. 
Also, these requirements will enhance the usability of products and services in environments with low light or high noise. For example, who wouldn't like ATMs equipped with visual and audible signals indicating where to insert your bank card or where the money comes out?
### Who needs to comply with the EAA?
The EAA will apply to a wide range of sectors, including ICT, e-commerce, banking, operating systems, and public transportation
If your business offers one of these products and services, you'll need to review the specific laws and regulations in your country that implement the Act to make sure you're in compliance. Although the deadline is knocking on the door, the good news is that you’ll have a three-year window to do it.
Every EU member country has its own set of penalties for not complying. For example, Germany definitely has some of the highest fines. Failing to meet the EAA requirements in Germany could cost you up to 500,000 EUR
In many countries, that's just the tip of the iceberg. Ongoing non-compliance can lead to more serious issues like mandatory corrective actions, public announcements of violations, and even the suspension of business operations.
Example of GDPR fines in the EU. Source: 
### EAA vs. WCAG
If you’ve heard about EAA, you’ve probably also come across WCAG. WCAG itself isn’t a law – it's a set of guidelines developed in cooperation with individuals and organizations worldwide, aimed to provide a unified standard for web content accessibility that meets different user needs.
Many accessibility laws, including those in Europe, use the WCAG 2[under four principles](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/fixing-the-most-common-accessibility-issues-in-web-development), meaning your content has to be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.
To meet these principles, you'll need to follow specific success criteria grouped into three levels:
  * Level Abasic
  * Level AAan industry standardrequired by the EAA‍
  * Level AAAhighest


### How to prepare for compliance
#### Get familiar with the basics
To make your accessibility efforts really work, it’s important to get the hang of [inclusive design](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/blog/how-to-implement-inclusivity-into-your-ux-ui-design). Our detailed guide on essential principles and practices breaks down the key UX/UI strategies that can make digital experiences easier and more user-friendly. From clear navigation and responsive layouts to accessible typography and multimedia, this guide will help you polish your approach and avoid common mistakes. Just remember to build on a solid foundation before you make any changes. Also, don't forget to check out the WCAG guidelines and make sure you’re following local accessibility laws.
#### Follow the accessibility checklist
Ensuring accessibility can feel overwhelming, especially with a due date in mind, but having a structured plan can really help. For example, the 
#### Educate your team
Another important step is to train your design and development teams
#### Use the right tools
Using the right tools is key to keeping accessibility on track. They can help your designers and developers spot and fix any issues. Besides the checklist, the A11y Project also offers guides, best practices, and tools to help out. If your team is designing in Figma, here are some handy plugins to check out:
  * a11y Color Contrast Checker
  * a11y Annotation Kit
  * a11y Focus Order


Another great resource is Stark, which offers a useful Contrast & Accessibility Checker Text Resizer Include 
#### Monitor your progress
Note that accessibility isn’t a one-and-done thing, which means you’ll need to keep an eye on it, regularly check for updates, and stay in the loop with new trends to maintain consistency and compliance over time. Also, getting ready for the EAA is a great opportunity for your team to create detailed documentation that can work as a checklist and a handy guide later on.
#### Bonus tips
  * Involve people with disabilities‍
  * Conduct an accessibility audit[we can offer help](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ux-accessibility-code-audit#acessibility-audit), so feel free to get in touch.


### What’s next?
Accessibility is a long-term investment for the future of your product and business rather than another compliance checkbox to fill. Although there's still some time to implement the necessary changes, don't let that fool you. The EAA is here to remind us that accessibility is here to stay – not just to comply with the law but to expand your audience and ensure future success. 
Make sure accessibility remains an ongoing part of your design and development process, and if any questions pop up, don’t hesitate to reach out.

# Why 404 Error Pages Really Matter – And How You Create Them
Amra
UX/UI Designer
Spoiler alert: This article is not about listing “best practices” that show examples of cute images combined with awkward copy writing on 404 error pages. Rather, it’s about what a really good user experience for 404 error pages contains, and how important 404 pages are for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). In this article, you'll learn why your 404 error page matters – and how you can get it right.
### Oops, something went wrong!
‍
### 404 pages and their importance for SEO
However, having users dropping out of your website is not only a problem for the user experience, it’s also bad for your website’s SEO. But why is that so? Quite easy: Everybody wants to be seen and found on the first page(s) of search engines. For our example we’ll use Google. So if you are not running with a “Paid Search” you have to take care of being ranked organically, which is affected by the algorithm of Google. The algorithm depends among other things on the tracking of users’ behaviour, which means in conclusion, that good or bad user experience has an impact on your organic ranking, as long as it’s trackable. This leads us back to the importance of good [UX/UI design](https://www.cobeisfresh.com/ux-ui-design-agency) for websites and 404 error pages. As long as you keep your users interested and guide them through your website (including error pages) the way they expect, your Google ranking should be fine. However, if you break these simple rules, your favourite search engine will make you pay for it.
### How to 404
Now that you’ve got an idea of how a great 404 error page can positively impact both your visitors’ user experience and your website’s SEO ranking, it’s time to create the perfect 404 error page. Let’s turn this potentially negative experience into a positive one by showing your users the way back to the beautiful experience that is your website, and the relevant content they were looking for! Here are some simple steps to get it right:
#### 1. Be transparent…. and helpful
Part of a good user experience is to acknowledge and clearly mark an error. Therefore, in most cases, it’s better not to include automated linking instead of 404 pages that lead the user back to your landing page (for example). As we all know: Nobody’s perfect! We’ve all got our (website-)flaws, so let’s show the world how to handle them: with a beautiful and functional design, with a copy explaining what happened, and indicate what users can do to get back on track.
#### 2. Include features
Being transparent and helpful is already great, however, there’s even more you can do! Besides the visual and textual elements, your 404 error page should also include potential features that can be embedded on your error page, such as a search bar, a way for users to report a broken link, a contact page or a contact form.
#### 3. Include links 
Next to special features, links can do a great job for the user experience, too: They allow users to be picked up, find their way around, and see the next step clearly in front of them. A few useful links for your 404 error page are your home page, your most popular blog articles, your most popular or valuable product/category pages, so-called “lead magnets” (whitepaper downloads, demo sign-ups etc.), and incentives (voucher codes etc.).
#### 4. Let your brand shine
Do not see your 404 page as a necessary evil in your website’s dusty hidden closet. It has the potential to set the stage for your visitors to have a remarkable brand experience as well. So get creative here, show the face of your brand, and represent yourself via a beautifully designed error page. 
### Best Practices
Last but not least, some examples and real best practices of well designed 404 error pages. Get inspired and enjoy!
In addition to the copy and graphics that match the brand, Tripadvisor shows how to properly design a 404 error page: 
1. The website menu combined with a search box is still visible
  1. Quick access to useful and most used categories


Everybody wants to feel safe while booking a flight for their next travel adventure. While giving quick access to most needed categories, and the menu as well, Emirate communicates calmness and security in their headlines, while offering to get in touch with the service and handing off to the site map for a greater page overview – a good way to help users navigate away from the 404 error page.
By creating incentives (here: special member offers and top trending products) to keep your users on the page while promoting/selling some products, you kill two birds with one stone.
If you need a quick solution for your 404 error page, keep it (at least) classic and simple:
1. Classic:2. Simple: 
And if you still have some time left, because the first two steps are implemented as fast as promised:
3. Add some of your brand love to the copy writing and graphics
…and voilà! Your 404 page is ready, neat and helpful.
‍COBE doesn’t offer any SEO (Search Engine Optimization) services. To answer the question of why we still talk about SEO in our blog and consider it in our design process: Google’s goal is to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” A good user experience is crucial to achieve that goal, and that’s why Google is getting better every day at tracking user’s behaviour, which automatically affects the ranking factor of every single website worldwide – and that leads us to the necessity of good UX, which again….is our passion. So stay tuned about our knowledge we want to share with you.

# Why Contextual Help Outperforms Onboardings in UX Design 
Luis
UX/UI Designer
Onboardings tend to complicate digital products, are hard to remember, and slow users down in completing their tasks. Yet, they're commonly used to inform and educate users. Why is that, and what can you do instead? After all, help is still a critical aspect of your product's user experience. Try contextual help! It can solve problems for both you and your users.
But, as expected, there's a catch. Isn't there always? 
In this article, you'll learn more about the differences between onboardings and contextual help, also known as pushpull revelations
### What is contextual help and how is it different from onboardings?
The role of onboarding is to educate new and existing users about the different features and functionalities of a digital product. They’re often used to either promote features, give instructions, or request data for the customization of an application. Onboardings can come in the form of deck-of-cards – most commonly used in mobile apps – coach marks, intrusive overlay windows or interactive walkthroughs.
What all of these onboarding forms have in common is that they disrupt the user experience. Onboardings push
On the other hand, contextual helppull
Contextual help often comes in the form of guidelines, tooltips, contextual overlays, wizards, or inline instructions.
### Sounds too good to be true? Here’s the catch
If contextual help seems like the natural choice, you might wonder why we still come across push revelations, such as deck-of-card onboardings, so often. Well, the answer lies between effort and benefit. 
To provide qualitative contextual help, it's essential to understand your user's intentions and goals accurately. Otherwise, there's a risk of interrupting their experience. But, it's important to note that understanding user journeys is very complex – mastering it takes time, effort, user testing, and hands-on experience. Certainly, there are cases where the user's intention is easy to determine. However, there are also times when it's necessary to employ systems to track and analyze user behavior in order to accurately anticipate their intentions.
When launching a new digital product, there’s a possibility that the costs to implement contextual help may outweigh the perceived benefits. This is why companies often opt for system-initiated push revelations, such as deck-of-cards, that require less effort in design and development – even when it’s proven that push revelations often 
Of course, there are cases when contextual help simply isn’t feasible due to high technical limitations. In addition, it’s generally always better to invest time in improving the usability of your product rather than explaining it. Nonetheless, contextual help, when implemented correctly, can and will bring real value to your product. And yes, it might take some effort to set it up, but you don’t have to be a big data company to do so. A good user experience designer will be able to implement contextual help with limited resources. I encourage you to try it because, in the end, it's the little things that make all the difference.
### Delighted by help: The importance of contextual help in your customer experience
Customers are flooded with digital products every day, and 
Customers expect high standards of user experience, without friction but with delight. What makes you stand out is the effort you put into every detail and every possible hurdle in your customer's journey. With contextual help, you create an experience that exceeds user expectations. In the long run, customer delight will become increasingly important in order for you to stand out from the competition.
### The golden rules of contextual help: do’s and don’ts
As previously mentioned – to identify the right moments and triggers to offer help, it’s crucial to understand your user’s journey, intention, and goals. This is the foundation of contextual help but also the most challenging and costly step. Start small, focus on one feature first, like a newly added app function, and work your way up from there. Depending on the context and your digital product, you can choose a suiting UX pattern, like tooltips, contextual overlays, or inline instructions.
When building contextual help, keep these guidelines in mind:
  * Provide help without disruption: 
  * Make the content easily visible and dismissable:
  * Use simple and concise language:
  * Offer more details through a button if needed:‍
  * If there are multiple steps, display help at each step: 


### Best practices – where contextual help shines
Let’s take a closer look at Google Calendar. A few months ago, Google decided to replace the “Reminders” feature with the existing “Tasks” feature. Knowing how many people use reminders in their everyday lives, they introduced contextual help to make the feature change as smooth as possible. Weeks before the change, Google added an inline instruction to the user’s current reminders, explaining that they will be turned into tasks. This way, users were given the control to make the shift manually. If they didn’t do it then, later they’d see a tooltip where their reminders had been, with an explanation of how they transitioned into tasks. 
At each point of the user’s journey, Google considered the user’s intent, which is to add a reminder. Only in the context of this soon-to-be-replaced feature did Google Calendar inform the user in a non-disruptive, simple, and easily dismissable way.
Once again, Google demonstrated this when they introduced the ""working locations"" feature to their calendar. In this case, a two-step guidance would only appear if the user clicks on the new ""working locations"" tab. This serves as the perfect example of educating users about a new feature at the right time and place without causing any disruptions.
Just remember, it doesn't have to be a new feature to make use of contextual help. For example, in Microsoft Teams, there's a hint to enter a message that appears above the text input field only if it remains focused for a long time without any input. This is very helpful (and very simple) for the users that need help figuring out what to do. For the users that use the message field as intended, however, the hint won't ever appear.
With a recent update to their operating system, Apple introduced a new feature to the ""Notes"" app, enabling users to mention other people in their shared notes. To inform users about this new feature and its implications, they displayed an inline instruction within the sidebar of their Notes app. This instruction stated that you can change your notification settings when mentioned in a shared note. Again, following the rules of good contextual help.
### Key takeaways
With contextual help, you can delight by exceeding user expectations. When mastered, it will help users at the perfect time in their journey, improving their current intention without disrupting it. In general, however, you should still focus on improving the usability of your digital product rather than explaining it. 
In situations where additional help is valuable, use pull revelations instead of push revelations, such as intrusive onboardings. Although predicting user intent can be a challenge and sometimes even requires data collection and analysis. But even if your resources are limited, as a good user experience designer, you can work with your experience and intuition. 
Trust your skills, follow the rules of contextual help, and enhance your products. With users' growing expectations and the strive for delightful experiences, contextual help will become even more important in the future.

# Working Remotely After Lockdown — How Ready Are We, Really?
Pauline
UX/UI Designer
The good, the bad, the ugly and the future.
Let’s be honest: Working remotely offers lots of positive side effects for both employees and employers. However, there are downsides of remote working as well. Let’s take a closer look at them to get a fuller picture.
In the last few months during lock down, many of us have become familiar with working from home on a daily basis. While the situation has been quite clear during the lockdown phase, the current situation seems to bring up many questions: Will we just go back to the previous “normal”? What may a “new normal” look like? As several tech companies like Facebook and Twitter announced, they are ready to let their employees continue working from home, even after the crisis. Are we ready for such change? Should we even make working from home an institutional right in order to reduce unfairness and inequality in the workforce? Just like many companies out there, COBE is confronted with these open questions, and as official guidelines and recommendations for companies to organise their teams are slowly phasing out, we need to find answers for ourselves.
## Working from home: the good, the bad, the ugly
The Good
Let’s be honest: Working remotely offers lots of positive side effects for both employees and employers.
Employees, for example, can make more out of their day, as they are able to manage their own time and not having to commute to work. The freedom to decide how to organise our everyday life a little more flexibly leaves us with great opportunities to improve our work-life balance, and, consequently, even enhance our life quality. Working from home may also give us more comfort on a bad day, hiding our feel-good-sweatpants and wool socks below our desk, while the pressure of socializing, putting a smile on our faces, and being socially present is reduced to the number of video calls we have in a day. On low-energy days, this allows us to focus our energy on work and devote ourselves to recovering. But even on days, when we do not feel under the weather, we are in our safe space, which fosters focus and productivity.
Employers, too, benefit from letting their teams work remotely, even after the crisis. Not only do they signal that they care for their employees’ work-life balance. They also show that they trust their teams instead of feeling the need to control them, while at the same time proving that they are open to flexible organisational models. This makes the company more attractive for potential applicants — and clients. And there are even more ways in which companies benefit from allowing their employees to work remotely, in post-crisis times: One of the most profound benefits for companies arises from the opportunity of being able to hire people from all over the world (or, at least, from the same of similar time zones), without being restricted to their location. This might make a company more attractive to people who would otherwise not be willing to move to the location of that company.
‍
The Bad
There are many more advantages that everyone may discover for themselves. However, there are downsides of remote working as well. Let’s take a closer look at them to get a fuller picture.
Not in all cases, remote working improves our work-life balance. As several studies show, working from home can sometimes cause us to work much longer, letting the boundaries between our work life and private life vanish. We catch ourselves sitting in front of our laptops on evenings and weekends, unable to disconnect from work matters — even after we switched off the computer. Turning our personal environment into our office makes it harder for us to draw a clear line between our work and our personal life. The consequences? An increase in mental stress and an unhealthy work-life balance.
One of the most important arguments against sticking to remote working is the fact that the social aspect of working in an office (or whatever your workplace may be) is neglected. Having no personal interaction with your colleagues, not sharing informal or personal conversations might have negative effects on the team spirit and the team cohesion — but also on the individual: Talking about your hobbies or your weekend plans can be very refreshing, uplifting and inspiring.
‍
The Ugly
However, while most of the previous thoughts have been elaborated on in the media already, many others haven’t. The questions we have only rarely addressed concern edge cases and inconvenient truths about the professional and personal situation of many among us: When everybody is working from home, how can we ensure that colleagues who have no safe space at home have a comfortable working environment? How can we ensure that teammates who experience loneliness or anxiety are not left alone when it was their office life that gave them stability? The same applies to people who live under circumstances which do not offer a safe, peaceful, quiet, and technically well-equipped working environment.
Yet, it is not only the personal, but also the professional situation of many people which might cause certain social groups to get left behind when remote working becomes a real thing. Service workers, healthcare workers and many others can, due to the nature of their job, not benefit from the potential work-life balance wins that working remotely offers. This brings up the two last questions of this section: Is the right to work from home really inclusive? Or does it sharpen inequality?
As this shows, the effects of the perks and perils of a remote working culture strongly depend on the kind of work we are doing, our personal situation, and our personality. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a concept of remote working from which everyone can benefit.
## WWCD? (What would COBE do?)
At COBE, we are always driven by the wish to improve ourselves and improve our company. To be able to do so, everybody has to bring in their ideas, and we need to try and test a lot of things. This is why we work with almost no hierarchy, following the organisational model of Holacracy. In this, each individual needs to be more responsible, and much more motivated than in strongly hierarchical organisations. For us, this is the first pillar of the foundation of a new way of working, which is predominantly based on flexibility and trust.
© Benedikt Matern
Our culture is very important for us. It marks the second pillar of our foundation, while at the same time being a major challenge in defining how we want to work post-crisis. For us, this means that we have to find a way to combine the advantages of an office-based culture, which used to strongly benefit from personal interaction, with the advantages of working remotely. Building on the strong team spirit we have established in the past, we use our culture to make sure that everyone feels as an equal part of the team — whether working from home or from the office. Our culture, not our office, is the safe space in which no one gets left behind.
To maintain this culture, measures must be taken to promote cohesion. The interpersonal component, which used to be a strong part of our culture, must not be neglected either. For this reason, we established a series of events that allows everyone to take part — from anywhere: We came up with an office yoga class, which could be joined via live stream. We also have daily remote coffee meetings for informal conversations and checking in on each other.
Yet, it might be difficult for team members who only work remotely and never join the team physically to experience (and shape!) the corporate culture. From what we learned, team members who work remotely most of the time strongly benefit from joining the team in the office every once in a while.
## A cautious forecast
Establishing a healthy, inclusive and effective remote working culture requires a strong base that allows everybody to be part of the team — no matter their physical location. Most likely, it will become a given for employees to choose their own workspace, which will have negative consequences for employers who are not willing to let their teams work remotely.
But let’s think a little bit further. Due to the rapid digitalization of every aspect of our lives and due to the fast pace of social change we experience in our day and age, being agile becomes increasingly important. Therefore, we should maybe ask questions such as the following: Is it going to be necessary to even have an office space? Is the idea of an office space outdated? Or will it be more efficient to just rent meeting rooms that we’ll use when needed? Or should we keep offices as we know them, but sublet them flexibly to other companies? Will we be able to even create environmental benefits from sharing our office spaces?
We are heading towards a world in which working, for many of us, will be different from what we have known until now. It makes sense for every company to deal with this topic in order to meet the expectations of the current and the future workforce: Not only working from home, but working from wherever we want to may become the norm in the future.
We should not only prepare ourselves for this near future, but actively pave the way for it by figuring out how a flexible working culture can work best, without friction and losses. The process of figuring this out may be frustrating at times, as there are no easy answers at hand. However, as uncertainty lays ahead of us, the future invites us to go on an adventure and leave behind old norms and beliefs. So let’s embark on this journey, share ideas, discuss options, fight our fears — and move forward.

# You Don’t Need Automated Testing?
Ivan
Quality Assurance
Hello fellow reader, today we’re going to talk about the importance of automated testing. If you’re still testing all your products manually, and don’t see why you should switch to automated, keep reading.To be clear, there are several situations when manual may be more suitable than automated testing, however, situations like that occur much less frequently.
## ‍‍
These are the cases when manual testing may be more appropriate than automated:
  * Starting a new project
  * Working on short-term and small projects
  * What about the human factor?!
  * Unstable environment
  * Do we have the right tools? 


To elaborate…
Starting a new project 
Short-term and small projects
Human factor 
Unstable environment 
The right tools‍
## Benefits of automated testing
After rethinking the situations above, you’re ready for the next step - getting familiar with the benefits of investing in automated testing. 
  * Time and money
  * Early detection of errors
  * Improves accuracy
  * Reliability
  * Faster than manual testing
  * Frequent and thorough testing
  * Increase in efficiency
  * Ensuring consistency
  * Not a subject to the human error factor
  * The tests are reusable


Sounds compelling, right? Let’s dive into it a bit deeper though.
### Time and money 
I’m aware of how a large investment would initially repel anyone, but if you stop and think of it as an investment in the future, then it should do the opposite. I’m sure you’ve heard of ROI (return on investment). Well, that’s what you’re trying to achieve here. So, not only will every penny you invest pay off, but you’ll also save time.
Take a look at the graph below.
The initial investment is always higher, but less than halfway through, you see how much you’re saving. This is when your period of happiness begins. 🤗
Do you still want to invest less in the beginning, only to invest more‍
### Early detection of errors
The main benefit of detecting errors early on is saving money. It’s a well-known fact that fixing an early detected error is much cheaper than fixing errors detected in the later stages of a project. After implementing new features, but before testing them, we normally apply a so-called **Smoke test** that confirms that the key, most important features in the app are still functional. The manual performance of the SmokeSmoke
Do you still think investing in the development of automated tests does not save you moneytime
### No human error factor 
As much as people strive for perfection, we’re still very human. And it’s a human thing to make mistakes. Especially when we’re surrounded by external factors that affect our work. 
Source: scnsoft.com
Unlike humans, automated tests are not affected by:
  * External factors
  * Tiredness
  * Boring repetitive actions


Although there is constant talk about the importance of the human factor QA engineers bring to the table, sometimes it’s the human factor you want to exclude.‍
### Faster than manual testing
Automated testing has been proven to work faster than manual - certain studies show it makes an astonishing 70% difference.
To back that up, I’ll talk about something called a RegressionRegressionRegression
And please don’t start with the whole “but how much time do we lose on developing an automated test”, because the time spent developing it, is incomparable to the time and number of manual Regression
Do you still think investing in automated tests is unnecessary?
## Final thoughts
Don't worry, manual testing is still on the table, but it’s important to find a balance between manual and automated and to choose the right way when necessary. When developing any product, it’s important not to skimp on quality,
So next time you find yourself in a situation where you could invest in the development of automated tests, think of me. I mean, of all the benefits I’ve just listed for you. And let me know how it goes. 😊

# Data Privacy
## Preface
Thank you for your interest in our website. We, COBE GmbH, take the protection of your personal data seriously and would like to inform you at this point about data protection in our company.
Within the scope of our responsibility under data protection law, additional obligations have been imposed on us by the entry into force of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679; hereinafter: ""GDPR"") in order to ensure the protection of personal data of the person affected by a processing (we also address you as a data subject hereinafter with ""customer"", ""user"", ""you"", or ""data subject"").
Insofar as we decide either alone or jointly with others on the purposes and means of data processing, this includes above all the obligation to inform you transparently about the nature, scope, purpose, duration and legal basis of the processing (see Articles 13 and 14 GDPR). With this statement (hereinafter: ""Privacy Notice""), we inform you about the manner in which your personal data is processed by us.
Our data protection notices have a modular structure. They consist of a general part for any processing of personal data and processing situations that come into play each time a website is called up (A. General) and a special part, the content of which relates in each case only to the processing situation specified there with the designation of the respective offer or product, in particular the visit to websites as detailed here (B. Visit to websites).
## A. General
### 1. Definitions
Following Art. 4 GDPR, these data protection notices are based on the following definitions:  

  * ""Personal data"" (Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (""data subject""). A person is identifiable if he or she can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, an online identifier, location data or by means of information relating to his or her physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity characteristics. The identifiability can also be given by means of a linkage of such information or other additional knowledge. The origin, form or embodiment of the information is irrelevant (photographs, video or sound recordings may also contain personal data).
  * ""Processing"" (Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR) means any operation which involves the handling of personal data, whether or not by automated (i.e. technology-based) means. This includes, in particular, the collection (i.e., acquisition), recording, organization, arrangement, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment, combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of personal data.
  * ""Controller"" (Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR) means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
  * ""Third party” (Art. 4 No. 10 GDPR) means any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons who, under the direct responsibility of the controller or processor, are authorized to process the personal data; this also includes other group-affiliated legal entities.
  * ""Processor"" (Art. 4 No. 8 GDPR) means a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller, in particular in accordance with the controller's instructions (e.g. IT service provider). In terms of data protection law, a processor is in particular not a third party within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 10 GDPR.
  * ""Consent"" (Art. 4 No. 11 GDPR) of the data subject means any freely given, informed and unambiguous expression of will in the form of a statement or other unambiguous affirmative act by which the data subject indicates that he or she consents to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.

### 4. Legal basis of data processing
By law, any processing of personal data is in principle prohibited and only permitted if the data processing falls under one of the following justifications:
  * Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a GDPR (""consent""): if the data subject has voluntarily, in an informed manner and unambiguously indicated by a statement or other unambiguous confirmatory act that he or she consents to the processing of personal data relating to him or her for one or more specific purposes;
  * Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. b GDPR: If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request;
  * Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. c GDPR: If the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject (e.g., a legal obligation to keep records);
  * Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. d GDPR: If the processing is necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person;
  * Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. e GDPR: If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; or
  * Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f GDPR (""Legitimate Interests""): If the processing is necessary to protect the legitimate (in particular legal or economic) interests of the controller or a third party, unless the conflicting interests or rights of the data subject override (in particular if the data subject is a minor). 


### 5. Data deletion and storage period
Your data will only be processed for as long as it is necessary to achieve the processing purposes listed below.
In addition, data may be stored if a (threatened) legal dispute with you or other legal proceedings are pending, or if storage is required due to legal regulations to which we are subject as the controller (e.g. Section 257 HGB, Section 147 AO). These statutory retention periods can be up to 10 years.
### 6. Data security
We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or against unauthorized access by third parties, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, as well as the existing risks of a data breach (including its probability and impact) for the data subject. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.
### 7. Recipients of the personal data; Cooperation with processors
We cooperate with our sister company COBE d.o.o., Ulica Hrvatske Republike 33, 31000 Osijek, Croatia. If it is necessary for the processing of your request, we also transfer your personal data to COBE d.o.o.
Like any large company, we also use external service providers in Germany and abroad to process our business transactions (e.g. for IT, logistics, sales and marketing). These service providers act exclusively on our instructions and have been contractually obliged by us to comply with data protection regulations in accordance as per Art. 28 GDPR.
### 8. Conditions for the transfer of personal data to third countries

We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer at the relevant points below.
Some third countries are certified by the European Commission as having a level of data protection comparable to the EEA standard through so-called adequacy decisions. When transferring personal data to other third countries, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible through binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data, certificates or recognized codes of conduct. Please contact our data protection officer (see A.3.) if you would like further information on this.
### 9. No automated decision making (including profiling)
We do not intend to use any personal data collected from you for any automated decision making process (including profiling).
### 10. No obligation to provide personal data.
For you as a customer, there is also basically no legal or contractual obligation to provide us with your personal data; however, it may be that we can only provide certain offers to a limited extent or not at all if you do not provide the data required for this, e.g. if you do not provide your contract details on our contact form.
### 11. Legal obligation to transmit certain data
We may, under certain circumstances, be subject to a specific legal or statutory obligation to provide lawfully processed personal data to third parties, in particular public bodies (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. c GDPR).
