#  Privacy PolicyWe take your privacy seriously. Find out how we do it.
Thank you for visiting our website [www.ergosign.de](http://www.ergosign.de) and for your interest in our company. Protecting your personal data is important to us. Personal data is information about the personal or circumstantial matters of a specific or specifiable natural entity. This includes, for example, your full name, address, telephone number and date of birth, as well as all other data that can be linked back to an identifiable person. As personal data enjoys special legal protection, we only collect it when it is absolutely necessary for the provision of our website and services. Below, we explain what personal data we collect during your visit to our website and how we use it. Our data protection policy complies with legal regulations, especially those in the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the Telemedia Act (TMG) and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We will only collect, process and save your personal data insofar as this is required for the functional provision of this website and our content and services, as well as processing requests and orders/contracts and only insofar as there is a legitimate interest in the sense of article 6 paragraph 1 s 1 lit f of the GDPR or another permission. Only if you have granted your express permission will your data be used for further purposes outlined in the permission, e.g. for sending advertising material in the form of a newsletter.  
  
Personal data (usually referred to just as ""data"" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.  
  
Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the ""GDPR""), ""processing"" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.  
  
The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.  
  
Our privacy policy is structured as follows:
  * I. Information about us as controllers of your data
  * II. The rights of users and data subjects
  * III. Information about the data processing

### II. The rights of users and data subjects
With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right
  * to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
  * to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
  * to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
  * to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR); 
  * to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).


  
In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.
  
Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.  
  

### III. Information about the data processing
Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
  

#### Server data
For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.

The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
  

#### Cookies

### Our recipe for happy employees
What does BGM mean and what is it about?
BGM stands for Betriebliches Gesundheitsmanagement or Corporate Health Management, encompassing systematic and sustainable strategies and measures within a company to promote the health and well-being of employees. Alongside occupational safety and corporate integration management, workplace health promotion is considered the third pillar of BGM.
Why is comprehensive corporate health management so important to us at Ergosign?
For us, Corporate Health Management is important both from a human perspective and from a business point of view. Satisfied, healthy, and happy colleagues have a positive impact on the work environment, which in turn increases motivation, performance, and productivity. This ultimately leads to higher customer satisfaction and, consequently, to long-term business success. Additionally, we also want our employees to enjoy working with us.
In this context, it is particularly important to us to establish a holistic corporate health management system, as this is the only way to ensure its success. A healthy coexistence is consciously practiced within our company, and the implementation of our Corporate Health measures is promoted both individually and far beyond the usual workplace safety standards—and this from the very beginning.
When considering the different generations, it quickly becomes apparent that younger generations place increased value on the topic of health. Not only physical health and nutrition, but also mental health are coming into focus. As a company, it is important to consider these values in daily decision-making. This is where the management approach of Corporate Health Management comes into play.
Although this area may initially increase costs, the resulting benefits are significant — especially with regard to the resulting competitive advantages. These include, among other things, higher employee retention and positive impacts on recruitment. Our goal is to achieve a higher level of identification with the company among employees, to express appreciation, and thus to increase satisfaction in the long term. Potential applicants are now consciously looking for companies that offer exactly that. Ultimately, we also benefit from a higher referral rate. Therefore, we also reward every successful referral with a bonus through our 'Bring-a-friend' concept. A portion of the bonus is always donated to a charitable organization.
Zusammenarbeit auf Augenhöhe
Good intentions are great, but how do they become tangible?
Regarding occupational safety, all our modern sites have ergonomically equipped workstations and the latest hardware and software. Additionally, our cozy seating areas and creative rooms offer a varied work environment. But Corporate Health at Ergosign goes much further. Beyond fulfilling legal requirements for occupational safety, promoting mental health and physical well-being is also crucial. Since both areas are interrelated, it is essential to foster both aspects in a holistic context. We promote physical health through an EGYM Wellpass membership, allowing employees to enhance their fitness where they only pay a small monthly contribution. This benefit not only encourages physical activity but also allows for the exploration of new sports or massages. Additionally, our sites regularly participate in (company) runs, meet for soccer games, or arrange climbing or hiking outings.
In the realm of physical health, we also offer subsidized job bikes, providing employees with an eco-friendly transportation alternative that also promotes personal fitness. Healthy nutrition plays an equally important role in physical well-being. Therefore, we ensure a diverse range of food options at our internal (and external) events, accommodating various dietary preferences. Naturally, we also have the obligatory fruit basket.
Moreover, in spring 2023, we hosted a Cook & Learn event led by a nutritionist and supported by our health insurance provider. This day focused on healthy eating and meal prep for the workplace. After a theoretical session on the importance of macronutrients, the learned concepts were immediately put into practice in our kitchen by cooking various dishes. This cooking course even led to the creation of an internal recipe app, which you can read more about [here](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/forx-interview/).
Catering bei Ergosign
Regarding mental health, we offer both internal and external training and seminars on topics such as time and self-management or self-efficacy. Additionally, our Persons of Trust have undergone training as ""Mental Health First Aiders."" This qualification equips them with the knowledge to appropriately support employees who seek their help. It is also crucial for the advising person to know and set their boundaries, protecting their own mental health and clearly identifying when professional support is needed.
At Ergosign, we have established preventive measures to promote mental health. Our working hours are flexible and can be adjusted as needed and in consultation. Overtime is not the norm but will be compensated 1:1. Moreover, our employees have the opportunity to take a workation within the EU or Switzerland. Working from a holiday location not only promotes relaxation but also ensures childcare during extended family vacations, for example, during school holidays. We offer workations for up to four weeks per year. Additionally, we have developed various time-out models. After 2.5 years with the company, employees can take advantage of a time-out.
Workation in Schweden
We also support families with a childcare cost subsidy. This benefit is not directly related to corporate health promotion but aims to provide financial relief. Considering the challenges families face today (e.g., lack of childcare options, high daycare costs), the indirect impact on mental health becomes clear. With our subsidy, we aim to support our Ergosign families financially and lift their mental load. Additionally, we allow, of course, with the respective office's consent, pets at the workplace. This also helps reduce mental load by ensuring the care of their pets.
Der Feelgood-Manager in Stuttgart bei der Arbeit
Reviewing the measures mentioned, it becomes clear that workplace health promotion holds a special place in our company. Every person is unique, goes through different life phases, and has different needs depending on the circumstances. Therefore, it is essential to offer diverse measures that employees can choose from to find what suits them best. Our goal is to make our measures as individualized as possible to meet various needs as effectively as possible. Only when the offered measures are accepted, Corporate Health Management can be successful.
We are very open and welcome ideas and suggestions from our teams regarding desired changes or alternative offers, ensuring continuous economically feasible development in this area. After careful evaluation of the desired measures, implementation follows, if possible. The introduction of the EGYM Wellpass membership is an example of a requested measure. This request came from several locations, making it clear that we needed to address this innovation. After careful review and numerous internal consultations, we were able to fulfill this request, providing our team with a more flexible and versatile fitness offer. 💪

## Why a DXP is essential for building a stronger digital brand
A [Digital Experience Platform](https://ergosign.de/en/services/digital-platforms) (DXP) isn’t just for enterprise e-commerce anymore. Today, businesses of all sizes — from startups to public institutions — leverage DXP solutions to deliver consistent, user-focused digital experiences across all channels.
Modern DXPs combine powerful content management, personalization, and integration capabilities to help you meet user expectations at every digital touchpoint — from websites and mobile apps to self-service portals. Technologies like headless CMS, modular frontend architecture, and AI-driven personalization form the foundation for scalable, future-ready digital ecosystems.
#### DXP Starter Package – Fast track your digital brand presence
Big impact with a lean DXP solution: For MedTech startup SPECTO Medical, we created a high-quality landing page that brings cutting-edge medical scanning technologies to life through immersive AR, VR, and MR experiences. Built using Storyblok (a headless CMS), the site is fully SEO-optimized, fast-loading, and perfectly aligned with the expectations of the healthcare market.
#### DXP Scale Package – Efficient delivery of complex web infrastructures
Enterprise-grade websites with speed and consistency — For [STADT UND LAND](https://ergosign.de/en/work/stadt-und-land), a major real estate company, we delivered an accessible, high-performance website powered by Storyblok. Over 850 pages were migrated quickly and seamlessly, supported by editorial training and accessibility enhancements.
Key results:
  * 2x increase in website traffic within 3 months of launch
  * Improved SEO performance via structured content and Core Web Vitals
  * Compliance with BFSG accessibility standards
  * Sustainable, scalable content operations


[Rheinbahn](https://ergosign.de/en/work/rheinbahn/), Düsseldorf’s public transport provider, set the standard for future-ready transit websites. Using Scrivito, we developed a flexible, low-maintenance platform with exceptional user experience.
Platform highlights:
  * MVP with seamless cross-channel UX
  * Fast, scalable development with Scrivito CMS
  * Design system for efficient content creation and cost savings
  * Centralized hub linking services like subscriptions and career portal
  * Tool-ready architecture for future integrations
  * Customer-centric features like digital travel planning and mobile ticketing


#### DXP Advanced Package – Scalable digital transformation for large organizations
Modular, accessible, and future-proof digital platforms — for [Stadtwerke Düsseldorf](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/swd-headless-cms/), we delivered a modern web ecosystem that evolves with user needs. Migration from FirstSpirit to Storyblok was executed iteratively — without service interruptions.
Key features:
  * Modular design system in Figma and React
  * Integrated self-service tools (GraphQL, REST APIs)
  * Scalable Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure
  * [Hybrid migration](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/swd-hybride-migration/) of 800+ pages

### Potentials and Challenges — a summary by Ergosign
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly revolutionizing the digital world. Recently, the Chinese LLM DeepSeek-R1 (and -V3) has made headlines. With unexpectedly high efficiency and performance, it has not only stormed the app charts but also stirred up tech giants and investors. In this two-part Insights article, we will first look at LLMs in general and then delve deeper into DeepSeek.LLMs form the basis for numerous AI applications that come onto the market almost daily. These models are trained over months on huge amounts of text data using machine learning. After this training, they can understand, complete, translate, and even write texts creatively. Well-known examples are ChatGPT, LLaMA, and Claude.But what actually makes such a model, and what should influence the decisions for using certain LLMs in the company? Why are open-source LLMs like DeepSeek so interesting for companies?
A spotlight on Werner
Werner is essentially the mascot of the Fichtelgebirge — both in reality and in his digital version. This creates a high recognition value, even far beyond the borders of the Fichtelgebirge. People know Werner from the app, promotional films, print, and online media, so it was clear that Werner had to be on the kiosk as well.
He acts as a quick start guide, and after the first interaction with the kiosk, the character goes through various states as he shrinks down, but he never disappears completely. Werner is always available and serves as an anchor point for people who are not very familiar with interacting with a digital screen. This simplifies and makes navigation of the application more welcoming. By using Rive for the animation design, the transitions feel particularly smooth, and the movements appear natural.
A spotlight on Rive 
Rive is particularly well-suited for animations because it offers endless possibilities for high-detail animations. Additionally, Rive makes the handover to the developers easy. The Rive animation software, like Figma, is primarily a browser application, making it flexible and usable across different devices.
Developers receive a detailed handover with an animation preview, so they can understand exactly how the animation should behave and test it independently. However, design and development work hand in hand with Rive. The design team can do a lot of preparatory work and predefine the states. The development team can initialize the triggers provided by Rive, giving them full control over the animation.
The LLM landscape
Rive X Flutter integration
Both tools are regularly used by us, both separately and in combination. Rive animations frequently find their place on our website as well as in client projects, inviting interaction or creating a 'Wow' effect. Flutter, on the other hand, has established itself as an industry standard in app development.
Flutter allows pixel-perfect development with full control over the appearance of elements. The software is based on a single, cross-platform codebase, allowing the application to run on Android, iOS, and, with minimal adjustments, on desktop and web platforms as well.
Both tools are cross-platform by nature. The widget-based architecture of Flutter and the user-friendly APIs of Rive ensure that animations can be integrated into an app quickly and efficiently.

30/11/2022 • 7 minutes reading time
The second edition of the book ""Collaborative UX"" by Toni Steimle (UX Director & Head of Site Zurich) and Dieter Wallach (Managing Director) has recently been published. To mark the occasion, there was a short photo shoot with the proud authors. Senior Communication Manager Esther Barra grabbed the two to ask them a few questions about Collaborative UX, the improvements in the second edition, and the collaborative writing process.
#### What is the most significant advantage or added value of Collaborative UX Design?
Dieter:  
These different perspectives are introduced in methodically supportive collaborative workshops — even if this is perhaps shocking news for some UX designers who see themselves as heroes: we have heroes who want to be solely responsible for product or service development not matter. In UX design, we see ourselves more in the function of conductors. We orchestrate the collaboration, promoting methodically supported, emphatic cooperation in product or service development with a shared goal. I see this as the central concern of our process model.
#### How did the first book come about?
Dieter:  
  
Toni:  
  
Dieter:
#### It's great that you were able to receive direct ""market feedback"". What's new in the second edition?
Dieter:   
  
Toni:
#### Great! That sounds like a lot of new content. Who should read this book?
Dieter:

#### Writing such a book together is certainly not easy. How did the German-Swiss collaboration between you two work out during the writing?
Dieter  
  
Toni:  
The second edition was more about refinements, improvements, and additions. That made it easier because we could get started straight away without discussing basic principles, which enabled us to work more in a more targeted manner. The cooperation between Dieter and me is characterized by great mutual respect. Working together couldn't feel any better. There was never a case when Dieter corrected something online where I had the feeling: I have to undo it now, or he has now done it wrong - this never happened. And vice versa, it was always the case that he also accepted my arguments.
#### So much harmony in cooperation sounds enviable! Finally, I'm interested: Would you write the book together again?

We orchestrate the collaboration, promoting methodically supported, emphatic cooperation in product or service development with a shared goal. I see this as the central concern of our process model.
#### How did the first book come about?

Toni:  
  
Dieter:
#### It's great that you were able to receive direct ""market feedback"". What's new in the second edition?
Dieter:   
  
Toni:
#### Great! That sounds like a lot of new content. Who should read this book?
Dieter:
#### Writing such a book together is certainly not easy. How did the German-Swiss collaboration between you two work out during the writing?
Dieter  
  
Toni:  
The second edition was more about refinements, improvements, and additions. That made it easier because we could get started straight away without discussing basic principles, which enabled us to work more in a more targeted manner. The cooperation between Dieter and me is characterized by great mutual respect. Working together couldn't feel any better. There was never a case when Dieter corrected something online where I had the feeling: I have to undo it now, or he has now done it wrong - this never happened. And vice versa, it was always the case that he also accepted my arguments.
#### So much harmony in cooperation sounds enviable! Finally, I'm interested: Would you write the book together again?

## AI Meets Digital Experience 
Following its great success in Germany, our Digital Experience Conference finally had its debut in Zurich, on June 17, 2025. Right in the heart of the city – at Ergosign Switzerland AG – experts from design, marketing, technology, and strategy came together to explore a topic more relevant than ever: Digital experiences in the age of artificial intelligence.
The conference combined inspiring expert talks, hands-on insights, and valuable networking opportunities – all centered around one key question: How are AI and modern platform solutions changing the way we design digital experiences?
###  Rethinking CX: Inspiration, ideas, interaction
The day kicked off with a warm welcome by Oliver Kulpi (Managing Director, Ergosign) and Toni Steimle (UX Director, Head of Site Zurich & Basel), introducing the program.
The first deep dive was presented by Milena Suter (UX Designer, Ergosign) and Toni Steimle. Through concrete use cases, they demonstrated how artificial intelligence can be a consistent companion throughout every phase of the customer journey – from first contact to long-term loyalty. At the core was the idea of hyper-personalization: AI enables not only tailored communication but also proactive experiences that adapt to the user's life situation, needs, and even emotions. This fundamentally transforms interactions – from reactive responses to anticipatory solutions. What stood out was that every presented idea resulted in a measurable win-win situation, offering clear benefits for both users and companies. The shift in perspective from one-time transactions to sustainable, partnership-based relationships wasn’t just discussed – it was brought to life.
Next, Joon-Mo Lee (Director Growth Strategy, SMAL) challenged attendees to think critically with his talk: “AI can do it all – faster, cheaper, more emotional?” With a clear focus on brand identity, user emotions, and the limits of machine creativity, he questioned the typical promises made by AI – in a way that was inspiring, honest, and thought-provoking.
Toni Steimle, UX Director, Head of Site Zürich & Basel, Ergosign Switzerland AG
###  Platforms in transition – from technology to experience
After a short coffee break, Tobias Zapp (Principal UX Designer & Head of DXP, Ergosign) illustrated how Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs) can be made ready for the AI era. His core message: AI is not an end in itself, but a strategic lever for better digital products and customer experiences.
The final presentation came from Arne Lummerzheim and Daniel Hikel of Optimizely. In their joint talk, “Back to the essentials: How AI in modern DXPs gives marketers time for real marketing”, they showed how companies can use intelligent platform solutions to evolve their customer experience – efficiently, personalized, and at scale. Drawing on over 35 years of combined digital business experience and deep expertise in technology and brand management, they offered numerous practical takeaways.
###  Austausch, Apéro, Ausblick
To round off the afternoon, we invited everyone to enjoy a summer apéro with cool drinks and tasty snacks – the perfect atmosphere for relaxed networking. Conversations deepened around AI, platform strategies, and design. Whether it was about use cases, technology integration, or design approaches – the lively exchange made it clear: there is strong shared interest in innovative, AI-driven experience solutions.
A heartfelt thank you to all speakers, attendees, and partners who made this premiere in Zurich possible. 🙏

Anyone that has carried out a software test knows just how much work is involved. In the following article, we show you a concise summary of best practices for agile remote software testing.
Today is the day: time to test a software prototype.
Anyone that has carried out a software test knows this scenario well, and all the work that goes along with it. Participants have to be recruited and invited, and you spend the whole day carrying out three to four sessions. But there is an alternative that lets you reduce your workload and that is quick and simple to implement:
agile remote testing.
In agile remote testing, your participants take place in the test virtually, from wherever they are. If you master the following tips and tricks, you will get good results even more efficiently.
#### Saving Time: Participant Recruitment
Comission a Recruitment Agency
Recruiting for remote usability testing can be carried out by the customer or by an external service provider. Especially when dealing with consumer products, it makes sense to commission an external partner. You won’t just save time on organization but will also get ideal test participants from a huge pool of age groups within hours, complete with CVs and interests. Participant criteria and dates can be defined in advance. Most participants will have already carried out usability tests, so will be familiar with the process. This will save time on briefing.
A usability test should not exceed 5-8 participants. According to 
Have Replacements on Hand
It can always happen that a participant drops out. So you should always look for two to three people more. When you book participants via an agency, their factsheets will help you make your selection and you will have access to their email address or, better yet, their phone number. This ensures you can find a replacement quickly. As each drop-out will take up time, plan enough time between slots to avoid stress.
#### Well Prepared: Set-Up
Set Up and Check
Always use a LAN connection rather than WiFi to avoid any connection problems.
You call the participants using an online meeting tool (Skype, GoToMeeting, Teamviewer etc). The whole screen is recorded using a recording tool (such as Quicktime). Duplicate the screen so that all connected monitors see the same thing.
“Eye contact” between the participants and you as the moderator is provided via a webcam.
For the best sound quality, it is best to use additional speakers and an external microphone.
Don’t forget it’s important that you feel comfortable while you moderate the test. Before the session, set up the room so that you have everything you need within reach, and remove distractions out of the participants’ view.
Benefit of an Observation Room
Even though an observation room is not strictly necessary for remote testing, it still comes with some benefits.
Everyone involved in the project can follow the test without disruption and carry out a live evaluation of the findings in the form of a user journey map. Plan in enough time between test sessions to consolidate findings. This lets you save time later on by avoiding lengthy video evaluations.
Schematischer Aufbau eines Beobachtungsraums
#### Ready? Preparation and Technology
Send Participation Form in Advance
To ensure that remote testing can begin immediately at the start of each session, you should send the participation form to participants in advance. Especially if the participants have to take on a role, for instance, it is beneficial to provide this information in a timely manner.
For reasons of practicality, the non-disclosure agreement is recorded verbally on the soundtrack. In the future, you could request a digital signature at this point. As this process currently requires certain hardware for each participant, it is not yet standard practice.
Test documents - such as content for forms or specific behavioral requests - should NOT be sent in advance so that the test is not affected.
The actual tasks are read out by the moderator during the test, as it is hard for the participants to switch between prototypes and tasks.
Professionalism is Important
Make sure to be professional even before the testing begins. It makes a better impression among the participants if you call them from an official company account. As they can see you, clothing should also be appropriate.
Start each session with an official greeting in which you introduce yourself and your employer, and explain what the test will entail. Tell them that they can ask you questions at any time. It is also important that the participants know that the test can be stopped at any time. Nobody should feel forced.
Explain Participant Set-up in Advance
Always remember that the participants’ equipment is mostly not professional. They mostly carry out discussions and tests at home and mostly use low-quality microphones, cameras and/or computers. Dips in connectivity (e.g. buffering) must always be taken into account when scheduling.
If the participant is lit from behind, for example, tell them and ask them to find another place for the test where you can see their face. Distracting pop-ups (e.g. antivirus) often open automatically. You can prepare your participants with a test call before the session. Explain step by step how to start the prototype.
Weise Deinen Probanden darauf hin, wenn er nicht gut zu sehen istAlle störenden Meldungen sollten vor Beginn des Testings deaktiviert werden
#### YOU’RE LIVE!
Providing the Prototype and Instructions
To ensure latency-free interaction with the prototype, you should make it available on a password-protected server. After the introductory questions, you should provide the necessary information via chat.
After the test, you can transfer your screen to address questions in detail. This has the benefit of allowing you to jump to certain content more quickly.
Place the Prototype in the foreground
In order to be able to completely understand the prototype, you must inform your participants that camera windows and other distracting windows should be closed.
As the participants have different hardware and screen resolutions, static prototypes may not be completely visible and may have to be cut horizontally. Important operating elements cannot be properly viewed.
Ask the participants to minimize the zoom in their browsers or to center the field of view on the prototype.
Achte darauf, dass der Proband den kompletten Prototyp im Blick hat
#### Last but not least
Watch your Body Language
As the participants can see the moderator and minute taker on the camera most of the time, you should watch your body language. Positive body language will motivate and encourage the participants to solve their tasks.
Achte darauf, was Deine Körpersprache aussagt. Bitte nicht gelangweilt wirken 😉
Be Friendly and Helpful
Always make sure to be friendly so that the participant feels at ease. With your positive presence, you will encourage participants to give open feedback. The situation becomes more open and communicative, which is essential for good testing.
Of course, you should keep calm during technical problems. After all, a solution is usually quick to find with a cool head.

The energy market is currently undergoing a significant transformation. Energy providers face many new challenges today, from rising costs and government-capped electricity and gas prices. The industry must transition to get out of this crisis.
> What are the buying criteria when prices are no longer competitive?
The short answer to this question is: digital services with an excellent customer experience. They are the decisive difference and create customer loyalty now and in the future.
### Customer experience supports the energy transition
Our relationship with energy and our energy provider is changing. The energy industry is in a transitional phase, moving away from the old model where price was the decisive competitive criterion. Caps on electricity and gas prices and the urgent need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels demand new solutions and open up many opportunities for interaction between energy providers and customers.  
An important aspect of the energy transition is also improving the customer experience. Energy providers must put their customers at the center and offer them a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly experience.
#### Go digital - communicate consciously
Customers share far more digital touchpoints with their energy provider than many think. Of course, the company website with a customer portal is essential for contract conclusion and self-service functions. But when looking for a new provider, most customers use comparison tools.  
  
This means: the appearance on external platforms must also be considered.  
  
People expect answers: when and where they interact with a product or service - at the point of sale. Providers should know how they can steer and design this communication.
> What questions will customers have for their energy service providers? Where do they get information about your company or products?
To deliver the right answers, providers must make strategic decisions: when and how to design touchpoints and what which content and interactions builds trust.  
  
Customers want to know more about brand promises, such as sustainable production, and they expect these promises to be observed. The increasing desire for customization affects the energy sector mainly in the customer's requirement for flexible tariffs and transparency in consumption. Companies must understand how ambitions, self-image and living habits have changed and what customers focus on today. Information about energy use, the possibility of monitoring and controlling energy consumption, and providing offers and incentives to promote renewable energy sources are important.  
  
An example of such an initiative is the introduction of smart meters, which allow customers to monitor and control their energy use in real-time. This helps customers optimize their energy behavior and save costs while promoting the energy transition.
It is a design task to make contents intuitively graspable and a suitable technological basis is needed to offer the right form of content at the right moment. Individual design decisions will have immediate strategic effects - the designer's scope of work will expand here. And no, AI will not have a solution to all problems. Branding, marketing, customer service, and operational processes have to plan ahead.
> How can we tackle these new challenges? Which tools can we offer energy providers to meet growing expectations?
#### A digital experience platform with a focus on customers and employees
People create successful digitalization. There is no predefined set of tools. That's why the employee experience is just as important to us as the customer experience. A digital experience platform is the central building block for creating, managing and delivering individual digital customer experiences.  
With a [digital experience platform](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/dxp.ergosign.de), or DXP, it is possible to maintain content and data completely independent of touchpoints: this is the basis for a real omni-channel strategy for content, services, or e-commerce. We have already successfully implemented this for our customer MAINGAU Energie. Read more in the [MAINGAU Energie Case Study](https://ergosign.de/en/work/maingau-energie/).
In addition to seamless data processing, the design (look & feel) and interactions must be touchpoint-adaptable, with a consistent brand representation. A [design system](https://ergosign.de/en/services/ux-design/) provides the necessary rules for all touchpoints. As a building block for UX design and development, a design system helps to create consistent digital interactions. Because once the components are set up in a design system, they only need to be adjusted once, instead of individually per touchpoint. Consistency is always maintained, which is essential for a good user experience and thus also for customer loyalty.
#### New opportunities - Energy providers can strengthen customer loyalty
The energy industry is evolving and providing energy providers with new opportunities to strengthen customer loyalty. Customer expectations have increased due to new technologies and the electrification of our daily lives. Almost everything is now „smart“ and has an energy demand. Networking and efficient device controls are a way of creating sustainability for consumers. Energy providers can offer their customers individual and flexible tariffs, a custom-made product range and an exclusive customer relationship through a self-service portal. Loyalty programs can reward responsible, ecological behavior and strengthen loyalty at the same time. In our [Spotlight on Energy](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/energy/) we deal intensively with these topics.
#### Optimized IT processes and data control
Given the high cost pressure in the energy industry, energy providers need to reduce the costs of their IT infrastructure and software and optimize and standardize their workflows. Classic CMS solutions alone no longer meet the requirements. More than a single software solution is needed to deliver perfectly orchestrated and personalized customer experiences regardless of the touchpoint.  
The faster products, services, or content can be created and published, the greater the competitive advantage. A modular and interconnected DXP architecture allows for quick and centralized creation and publication of content and functions. However, only an aligned organization where everyone works together can achieve an outstanding digital experience.  
The resulting motivation and personal commitment is the compelling difference of a human-centered organization. In [Organizational Design](https://ergosign.de/en/services/organizational-design/), we work out together with our customers, which foundation must be created.
#### My summary: People should be at the center of your business!
The customer experience plays a vital role in the successfully implementing the energy transition. Energy providers should ensure that customers are adequately informed and involved.  
In conclusion, the energy transition and customer experience improvement are closely linked. They offer energy providers the opportunity to advance their sustainability agenda and offer their customers a sustainable and cost-efficient energy supply.

Editor comment: this article by Toni Steimle and Dieter Wallach originally appeared in 
You can find the first part of the article, which describes the various workshops, [here](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/collaborative-ux-design-workshops-1/).
To ensure that the seven workshops run efficiently and successfully, they follow a number of key principles. Some significant principles are shown as examples below.
#### 1. Results-Orientation
The workshop leader must already have an idea of achievable results before the workshop - not the content, of course, rather the structure.
Working with workshop cards is very helpful here. Workshop cards allow you to clearly visualize, flexibly adjust and expand on achieved results. The cards can also be used to pre-define the structure of the desired result.
Let’s take the example of the problem statement during the scoping workshop: the team wants to establish a mutual understanding of the problems, the target groups, compelling metrics to measure project success and the existing framework conditions. The structure of the problem statement is prepared so that the team can work out its content together using cards.
Structure of a Problem Statement Map
Using the set structure, the results are developed collaboratively step by step so that each workshop participant can easily understand.
Completed problem statement map
#### 2. Alone and Together
What would happen if a whole team tried to hold a car’s steering wheel to get to a destination? We wouldn’t want to be in the car. Some jobs are obviously better done alone. Let’s stay with the car example: it’s efficient to change between a mutual exchange of ideas and driving alone. In the team, we can discuss the best way to reach our destination and weigh up the pros and cons of various routes if necessary. Then we can decide on a driver to take over the steering.
Switching between solo and group activities is often effective as well as efficient. But which tasks are suitable for the whole team and which should be tackled alone?
Teamwork is especially difficult when there are many relatively small decisions to make. When we create a prototype, we make many decisions with differing reaches. Which navigation concept do we want to use? What level of sub-navigation are we intending to use? Which categories are we working with? If we were to look for consensus within the team for each of these decisions, we wouldn’t get very far: the discussion would be extensive and exhausting.
The creative method of design studio, for example, uses a fruitful interplay between individual and group work to generate solution suggestions for a problem area. This involves various steps. In the first step, the participants develop various solution suggestions independently. In the second step, the resulting individual suggestions are each presented and evaluated as a group. The participants then work on their drafts alone based on this feedback.
#### 3. Balanced
In good workshops, all participants get to speak; even those that normally hold back. At the same time, participants that normally speak a lot in any given circumstance should be reined in.
Rather than simply asking for contributions on a topic, we could, for example, ask the workshop participants to note down their ideas on cards and then present them.
An interesting example of a method that relies heavily on this aspect is the closing argument. It can be used directly after the design studio to make a selection from the developed ideas. Each workshop participant is asked to explain in a short statement which solution they prefer and why.
Only when all arguments have been made do all participants allocate points. The group then uses these to decide which solution to choose.
#### 4. Assumption-Based
In teams with different specialist backgrounds, estimations can differ greatly. Conflicts are unavoidable and not damaging in principle - on the contrary: they often contribute meaningfully to finding the solution.
There can be many conflicts in teams, as the members make different assumptions. Making assumptions is often unavoidable if a workshop is to progress; but it can be problematic if the resilience of these assumptions is not directly reviewed.
It is still important to be aware of the assumptions made. An assumption board can help.
In this board, identified assumptions are noted on cards during the workshop. Assumptions are gradually collected for later weighting. These assumptions are then entered into a coordination system with two dimensions: there is an evaluation of how serious an incorrect assumption would be for the project and an estimation of how much the team actually knows about the assumption.
Assumption Board
The assumption board allows team members to consciously discuss their assumptions and learn what backgrounds they have. They also evaluate them using the straightforward points system, which is easy for all participants to understand.
#### Final Word
Efficient collaboration is possible in a cross-functional team. The benefits of cross-functional cooperation during product conception are clear to see: the team’s multidisciplinary know-how flows into product design. Often, this means that problems are uncovered early on that would otherwise only become evident during commissioning. So, costly corrections and bad investments are avoided. The team can discuss all requirements and draft possible solutions; descriptive prototypes replace long specification documents. The effort taken to create comprehensive specification documents can be drastically reduced in interdisciplinary and cross-functional teams. The team involved can identify with a product concept - all team members are responsible for the product’s success.
Efficient and target-oriented workshops can significantly improve teamwork in many phases of countless projects, and make a considerable contribution to success.

There can be many conflicts in teams, as the members make different assumptions. Making assumptions is often unavoidable if a workshop is to progress; but it can be problematic if the resilience of these assumptions is not directly reviewed.
It is still important to be aware of the assumptions made. An assumption board can help.
In this board, identified assumptions are noted on cards during the workshop. Assumptions are gradually collected for later weighting. These assumptions are then entered into a coordination system with two dimensions: there is an evaluation of how serious an incorrect assumption would be for the project and an estimation of how much the team actually knows about the assumption.
The assumption board allows team members to consciously discuss their assumptions and learn what backgrounds they have. They also evaluate them using the straightforward points system, which is easy for all participants to understand.
#### Final Word
Efficient collaboration is possible in a cross-functional team. The benefits of cross-functional cooperation during product conception are clear to see: the team’s multidisciplinary know-how flows into product design. Often, this means that problems are uncovered early on that would otherwise only become evident during commissioning. So, costly corrections and bad investments are avoided. The team can discuss all requirements and draft possible solutions; descriptive prototypes replace long specification documents. The effort taken to create comprehensive specification documents can be drastically reduced in interdisciplinary and cross-functional teams. The team involved can identify with a product concept - all team members are responsible for the product’s success.
Efficient and target-oriented workshops can significantly improve teamwork in many phases of countless projects, and make a considerable contribution to success.

Did you know that text is difficult for many deaf people to use, almost like a foreign language?
In actuality, reading and writing are often a major barrier for people who are hard of hearing that not only makes everyday life significantly more difficult in general, but also analogue and digital searches for information as well as interacting with media. Together with our research partners, we have joined the AVASAG project to find a solution to overcome these barriers.
There are around 70 million deaf people worldwide, with around 80,000 living in Germany (sourcesdepiction
#### The value of sign language
Sign language is an alternative that many deaf and people hard-of-hearing use — a visual manual language that employs the hands, facial expressions, line of vision, head and upper body positions as well as mouth movements. Sign language also has strong regional differences and dialects, resulting in more than 100 different sign languages existing across the globe.  
For deaf people globally, their own sign language is more than just a method of communication. It’s an important component of an independent deaf culture that manifested itself in the official recognition of German Sign Language (DGS) in 2002 as well as official legitimation in 2006 in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. And yet, the stark lack of sign language interpretation in everyday life and in the media, such as television and streaming services, shows just how much the deaf community is still excluded.

26/07/2023 • 8 minutes reading time
#### What happened?
During the night of July 15, 2021, the Ahr Valley was hit by a flood disaster. Entire villages and landscapes were engulfed in a matter of hours, and countless houses were destroyed. After the disaster many emergency services, aid organizations, and volunteers traveled to the affected areas.
Among the volunteers was the „Dachzeltnomaden"" community. They decided to stay in the Ahr Valley to provide permanent help and founded the ""Dachzeltnomaden Hilfsorganisation"" (DZNH; English= Rooftop Nomads Aid Organization). Affected individuals could contact DZNH and request assistance for the reconstruction of their homes. DZNH then took care of organizing a team of helpers and providing the necessary equipment.
The DZN in action
#### Problems immediately after the flood disaster
Especially during the immediate aftermath of the catastrophe, effective and efficient assistance was made difficult by many challenges: These included uncoordinated planning by public institutions, a lack of transparent information flow, and the absence of a central point of contact that could provide an overview of where help was needed and who could offer it. For example, the managing director of DZNH, Dennis, reported how THW (Technical Relief Agency) staff recorded important information solely by hand. He saw the risk of information loss and a significant shortcoming in sharing information with others.
#### Vision of a digital information platform for environmental disasters
These experiences led DZNH to reach out to us. Dennis had the idea of developing a digital platform that could serve as a central hub for information exchange and communication during environmental disasters. We were inspired by the DZNH's determination and wanted to help, so we initiated a joint pro bono project.
#### Understanding the challenges through service design methods
In the first step, we conducted a structured workshop with a small team from DZNH to gather and evaluate relevant information. Together, we defined a more precise problem statement, we identified relevant user groups, and visualized current workflows in the form of user journeys. It quickly became apparent that the idea of a digital information platform was quite ambitious, and we had concerns about future user requirements. As a result, we prioritized analyzing the DZNH organization to gain more clarity.
We asked ourselves: How can we optimize the processes of such an aid organization through digitalization? Is the kind of tool the managing director envisioned a suitable and viable solution for aid organizations? And can such a solution be scaled to meet the complex challenges that may arise during a flood disaster?
#### Interviews with the DZNH team
To better understand the processes and challenges of DZNH, we interviewed eight helpers from different camp areas. Due to time constraints, we conducted the interviews remotely, but we were able to get a glimpse of the camp through images.
We asked the helpers about their daily work and the challenges they face in collaborating with each other, other organizations, and the affected individuals. The synthesis of the interviews resulted in the following key findings:
  * Deficits in information flow were identified between management and the core team, which led to delays in critical situations for important organizational and budget-related decisions. Core team members felt somewhat restricted in their work.
  * Construction site planning and camp management generally worked well for most helpers. Only those core team members dealing with complex planning tasks wished for a better overview of the status quo of different construction sites.
  * A significant motivating factor for personal engagement at DZNH is the effortless process from registration to on-site volunteering and departure. Recurring helpers saw no friction points or areas for improvement in this process.
  * Face-to-face exchange conveyed a strong sense of community to all participants, which most helpers highly valued and considered their greatest motivation for being part of DZNH.
  * WhatsApp groups were the main digital communication channel, as WhatsApp is widely used and familiar to the helpers.


There was little mention of regular or close cooperation with other organizations and institutions (e.g., THW, other authorities) as it occurred only to a limited extent.
In addition to the interviews, we conducted research on ""Digitalization in Disaster Relief"" to learn from similar projects in other parts of the world, which highlighted the importance of network stability.Infrastructures can be damaged during disasters, making the use of digital communication and documentation channels difficult and unreliable. Data protection and data security also add complexity to the implementation, requiring comprehensive expertise and regulations.
#### A sobering result (initially)
Based on these findings, we concluded that developing a standalone digital platform for DZNH was not the appropriate solution.  
  
However, their processes could be optimized cost-effectively and efficiently with existing applications. We introduced them to the tool Trello and provided concrete suggestions on how to map and organize their construction site planning there. Instead of communicating through numerous and confusing WhatsApp groups, we suggested using a communication tool like Slack. This would allow DZNH teams to divide their topics into channels and assign relevant individuals. Maintaining an overview would be easy. With a smartphone app, Slack could be easily used by helpers with laptops at the camp or on the construction sites.
#### Conclusion
Research saves money and prevents inappropriate solutions:
  1. To ensure that digitalization can truly provide effective support, it is essential to understand the complexity of the requirements of all stakeholders involved in a process, as well as their levels of impact (ecosystem). In this project, the initial results from user research gave us a fundamental understanding of the needs of those involved in disaster relief in the Ahr Valley. Further research activities would be necessary to reliably assess the requirements for a digital central information platform.
  2. The problem assessments and assumptions about possible solutions made by individual stakeholders can be put into perspective with a comprehensive review and the journeys of all involved persons. We found that the core team of the DZNH as well as the volunteers are quite satisfied with their work process.  
  
This ultimately led us to the following:  
  

  3. There are numerous digital tools available on the market that can help plan and coordinate work processes. In order to optimize the structures and processes of DZNH, we suggested suitable, efficient, existing tools for communication and site planning.
  4. The larger the team, the more important it is to delegate appropriately. By distributing responsibilities within the core teams of DZNH, silos can be reduced. This, in turn, facilitates faster decision-making and brings more efficiency to everyday work.


We would like to sincerely thank all the Roof Tent Nomads for their dedication and hard work during the relief efforts in the Ahr Valley! Your motivation to take action and willingness to make changes for the greater good has been truly inspiring to us.  
  
We have learned a lot from you and are delighted that we could assist you in your work.

#### Starting Situation
When a company develops a new product or service, those responsible often have to deal with intense time pressure as well as manage employees from different departments. Digital products that are becoming more and more complex over time must be conceptualized and implemented in increasingly short timeframes. In this article, Toni Steimle and Dieter Wallach will show you how you can achieve your goals in seven workshops and always keep user experience in mind in their book Collaborative UX Design.

Their approach orchestrates the activities of an interdisciplinary team in collaborative product conception. The cornerstones of collaborative UX design are based on the approaches of design thinking, lean UX, agile development and people-centered models.
#### Part One: the Seven Workshops at a Glance
The product conception process begins with an analysis of the starting situation and of the problems to be solved: the project’s mission is explained. The team then works iteratively on finding solutions, coming up with various concept variations. The team members then come together to define a roadmap for the implementation of their solution concept.
Figure 1: Collaborative UX design process
Let’s take a closer look at the seven workshops. We’ve split up the problem analysis into two workshops:
#### 1. Scoping
In the Scoping Workshop, the team refines the core of the project’s mission together with the client. The team establishes the status quo of competing products and characterizes the special features, advantages and disadvantages of these solutions. A significant part of the scoping workshop is discovering the often implicit assumptions behind an order and specifying existing hypotheses about the users of an application. In the scoping workshop, critical assumptions are identified and research measures to review these are chosen.
After the scoping workshop, the defined research measures can be tackled: a work plan to prepare for the next workshop is created.
#### 2. Inspiration & Synthesis
In the Inspiration & Synthesis Workshop, the team members evaluate the results of research activities. To this end, they create descriptions of existing work processes and identify product changes for their optimization. Analyses in the inspiration & synthesis workshop allow the review of user assumptions and support the formulation of empirically founded personas as user representatives modelled on archetypes. At this point, it is important to reflect on the previously defined project mission: is this still compatible with the new knowledge or are corrections needed? Often, it can be helpful to involve management in inspiration & synthesis workshops.
These two looser workshops have been mostly concerned with establishing a comprehensive understanding of the problem: hypotheses are created, facts collected and hypotheses validated.
The following workshops concentrate on finding solutions.
#### 3. Ideation
In the Ideation Workshop, the team searches for solution ideas for identified product opportunities. In the workshop, various creative methods are used to inspire the team: the workshop’s aim is to generate the widest possible variety of ideas. The result of the ideation workshop is a prioritized catalog of product design ideas.
#### 4. Concept
In the Concept Workshop, participants develop the completed catalog of ideas to come up with a coherent solution concept. They develop a vision of possible use scenarios and use this as the foundations to come up with an image of a solution’s future functionality. An initial, and abstract at first, view of the future product’s user interface is created in the content workshop. This is then specified until there is a concept suggestion for the product.
#### 5. Prototyping
There are even more assumptions behind the complete concept suggestion: assumptions about user needs and the suitability of certain solutions. The identification of these assumptions forms the object of a Prototyping Workshop, aiming to create an initial interactive version of the product concept. The prototype’s validation is the core focus of the upcoming validation workshop. For this following workshop, the team members come up with a validation plan in the prototyping workshop that outlines what kind of prototype is suitable to validate the concept. They then begin to develop a prototype together. The aim isn’t to specify the solution, rather primarily to prepare the concept review.
After the prototyping workshop, the prototype is finalized and tested. It is then possible to observe users using the prototype so that feedback can impact the further development of the concepts.
#### 6. Validation
As already mentioned, participants evaluate the results of these observations in the Validation Workshop. They compile the recorded observations, before categorizing and weighting them. In the validation workshop, they continue to consider the originally defined assumptions and evaluate whether the developed concept is based on suitably robust foundations. If this question can be answered in the affirmative, the concept can be implemented in a small release and market feedback collected.
#### 7. MVP
In the last workshop — MVP planning— the team creates a product roadmap. The goal is to determine an initial minimal version of a compelling release, a minimum viable product. To this end, the team re-prioritizes the relevant product functionalities. Team members must take various factors into consideration, such as expected benefits for users and customers, contribution to the achievement of business aims and the cost of implementation. They choose the roadmap to allow for the formulation of reviewable hypotheses.

#### Starting Situation
When a company develops a new product or service, those responsible often have to deal with intense time pressure as well as manage employees from different departments. Digital products that are becoming more and more complex over time must be conceptualized and implemented in increasingly short timeframes. In this article, Toni Steimle and Dieter Wallach will show you how you can achieve your goals in seven workshops and always keep user experience in mind in their book Collaborative UX Design.

Their approach orchestrates the activities of an interdisciplinary team in collaborative product conception. The cornerstones of collaborative UX design are based on the approaches of design thinking, lean UX, agile development and people-centered models.
#### Part One: the Seven Workshops at a Glance
The product conception process begins with an analysis of the starting situation and of the problems to be solved: the project’s mission is explained. The team then works iteratively on finding solutions, coming up with various concept variations. The team members then come together to define a roadmap for the implementation of their solution concept.
Figure 1: Collaborative UX design process
Let’s take a closer look at the seven workshops. We’ve split up the problem analysis into two workshops:
#### 1. Scoping
In the Scoping Workshop, the team refines the core of the project’s mission together with the client. The team establishes the status quo of competing products and characterizes the special features, advantages and disadvantages of these solutions. A significant part of the scoping workshop is discovering the often implicit assumptions behind an order and specifying existing hypotheses about the users of an application. In the scoping workshop, critical assumptions are identified and research measures to review these are chosen.
After the scoping workshop, the defined research measures can be tackled: a work plan to prepare for the next workshop is created.
#### 2. Inspiration & Synthesis
In the Inspiration & Synthesis Workshop, the team members evaluate the results of research activities.

In the not too distant future, “autonomous mobility-on-demand” (AMoD) systems could provide around-the-clock, cost-effective and flexible mobility services without fixed schedules, stops or drivers, and controlled entirely via digital user interfaces.
In the research project Aperolapero[Insights article on APEROL](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/research-project-aperol/) we presented the project and the project partners as well as the motivation and core questions behind the project. This article highlights the design and development process.
Scribbles
#### Before the journey: Identifying challenges and requirements
The development of an AMoD system requires consideration of the heterogeneous needs of diverse stakeholders – from citizens, mobility service providers, transport companies and tour planners to urban planners and municipalities. We were able to balance these needs in the project and incorporate them into the development through our collaborative, methodical approach.
The success of AMoD depends on its acceptance by people and the trust they place in it. That is why future passengers were continuously involved in the early stages of the project – for example, through various online surveys with a total of several thousand participants, or as part of a representative dialog with residents in Aachen with 89 participants. Technical, economic and organizational requirements were also defined in further stakeholder workshops. Based on these findings, we developed usage scenarios and user journey maps in order to have a common basis for discussions with our project partners.
Design process
#### A great ride: The design process
How can we ensure the effective, efficient and satisfying interaction of passengers and the autonomous service before, during and after their journey? This is the question we asked ourselves at the beginning of the design process.
Digital user interfaces and trust-building communication play a central role here. When designing the user interfaces, we created a detailed requirements catalog based on the user journey maps together with our project partners, which describes and evaluates the system functions and technical requirements.
The service is designed to support users throughout their AMoD journey:
User Journey Map
The development of a mobile Companion App that bundles all the services of the fictitious AMoD system for the user is essential here. We also took into account other touchpoints of future users, such as interaction in and around the vehicle, for example via passenger information displays in the vehicle interior. This also led to questions about which forms of interaction are most suitable in different situations. In addition to the “classic” graphical UI design (GUI), we took a closer look in particular at the concept of text-based conversational UIs (chatbots).
> We presented the details at the ACM MobileHCI Conference 2021.
#### Next stop: Context-based evaluation in the Usability Lab
How does it feel to sit in a driverless shuttle? Which features in the vehicle and the app ensure trusting communication and improve the sense of security? Since there are currently not many driverless vehicles on the road, AMoD is still a somewhat “theoretical” topic with lots of open questions – a design challenge!
That is why we created a video-based simulator to realistically evaluate the concepts. The setup: We created an audiovisual simulation using audio and video recordings from real road traffic by setting up loudspeakers and projectors or screens. This relatively simple but immersive method allowed us to perform context-based prototyping and concept evaluation in the early stages of development.
Comparative evaluation of GUI and chatbot along the entire user journey in the video-based simulator.

#### A look under the hood: Cross-platform development with Flutter
The cross-platform framework Flutter was used to implement the APEROL frontend. Unlike other technologies, Flutter relies on its own widget library with replicas of the respective platform-native UI components. This gives Flutter full control over the rendering of the UI – regardless of the platform and its version. The tweaking of existing widgets is also quick, and custom widgets can be created by declaration with almost limitless possibilities.
This made Flutter ideal for the time-efficient as well as high-quality implementation of the APEROL Custom UI. On the backend, the app accesses a complex system of cloud-based algorithms for route planning (PSItms) and traffic simulation (MATSim) via an interface specified together with the research partners.
Developed user interfaces for on-demand test drives of the overall APEROL system in real traffic.
#### The home stretch: System test in real traffic with Wizard-of-Oz vehicle
After various workshops, evaluations and iterations of the apps, APEROL entered the home stretch – with a summative evaluation of the overall on-demand system in real road traffic in Aachen and Saarbrücken. The goal was to evaluate not only the user interfaces, but also the backend and route planning components in particular. A conventional vehicle (with driver) was used for this. But in order to still give the study participants the feeling of automated travel during the test drives, we implemented a Wizard-of-Oz vehicle setup.
The participants were provided in advance with the Companion App for download via Microsoft AppCenter. Our colleagues from Ergosign in Saarbrücken were able to book any two journeys on-demand on the trial days in March 2021 – for example, from home to work (in compliance with appropriate hygiene concepts due to the ongoing pandemic). In order to also examine the importance of passenger information displays in the interior, the participants received information about the course of the journey via the passenger information app during one of the two journeys, but not during the other.
The lightweight Wizard-of-Oz setup proved to be a suitable way to “simulate” AMoD in real traffic. Participants were selected when possible in advance for low susceptibility to simulator/travel sickness. The controllability of the real (on-demand) test drives was very limited (traffic volume, delays, booking parameters, etc.) compared to laboratory studies. The availability of information via in-vehicle displays seems to have a decisive positive influence on the acceptance of AMoD and the overall user experience (UX).
What is the next stop in the journey?
The findings from APEROL’s design and development process can be directly incorporated into the development of future systems. This will help shape the transportation transformation of the coming years and beyond, making it human-centered, demand-oriented and sustainable!
With the appropriate fleet size, this can lead to benefits in:
  * Social participation
  * Sustainability
  * Efficiency/comfort
  * Flexibility

The controllability of the real (on-demand) test drives was very limited (traffic volume, delays, booking parameters, etc.) compared to laboratory studies. The availability of information via in-vehicle displays seems to have a decisive positive influence on the acceptance of AMoD and the overall user experience (UX).
What is the next stop in the journey?
The findings from APEROL’s design and development process can be directly incorporated into the development of future systems. This will help shape the transportation transformation of the coming years and beyond, making it human-centered, demand-oriented and sustainable!
With the appropriate fleet size, this can lead to benefits in:
  * Social participation
  * Sustainability
  * Efficiency/comfort
  * Flexibility


In the not too distant future, “autonomous mobility-on-demand” (AMoD) systems could provide around-the-clock, cost-effective and flexible mobility services without fixed schedules, stops or drivers, and controlled entirely via digital user interfaces.
In the research project Aperolapero[Insights article on APEROL](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/research-project-aperol/) we presented the project and the project partners as well as the motivation and core questions behind the project. This article highlights the design and development process.
#### Before the journey: Identifying challenges and requirements
The development of an AMoD system requires consideration of the heterogeneous needs of diverse stakeholders – from citizens, mobility service providers, transport companies and tour planners to urban planners and municipalities. We were able to balance these needs in the project and incorporate them into the development through our collaborative, methodical approach.
The success of AMoD depends on its acceptance by people and the trust they place in it. That is why future passengers were continuously involved in the early stages of the project – for example, through various online surveys with a total of several thousand participants, or as part of a representative dialog with residents in Aachen with 89 participants. Technical, economic and organizational requirements were also defined in further stakeholder workshops. Based on these findings, we developed usage scenarios and user journey maps in order to have a common basis for discussions with our project partners.
#### A great ride: The design process
How can we ensure the effective, efficient and satisfying interaction of passengers and the autonomous service before, during and after their journey? This is the question we asked ourselves at the beginning of the design process.
Digital user interfaces and trust-building communication play a central role here. When designing the user interfaces, we created a detailed requirements catalog based on the user journey maps together with our project partners, which describes and evaluates the system functions and technical requirements.
The service is designed to support users throughout their AMoD journey:
The development of a mobile Companion App that bundles all the services of the fictitious AMoD system for the user is essential here. We also took into account other touchpoints of future users, such as interaction in and around the vehicle, for example via passenger information displays in the vehicle interior. This also led to questions about which forms of interaction are most suitable in different situations. In addition to the “classic” graphical UI design (GUI), we took a closer look in particular at the concept of text-based conversational UIs (chatbots).
> We presented the details at the ACM MobileHCI Conference 2021.
#### Next stop: Context-based evaluation in the Usability Lab
How does it feel to sit in a driverless shuttle? Which features in the vehicle and the app ensure trusting communication and improve the sense of security? Since there are currently not many driverless vehicles on the road, AMoD is still a somewhat “theoretical” topic with lots of open questions – a design challenge!
That is why we created a video-based simulator to realistically evaluate the concepts. The setup: We created an audiovisual simulation using audio and video recordings from real road traffic by setting up loudspeakers and projectors or screens. This relatively simple but immersive method allowed us to perform context-based prototyping and concept evaluation in the early stages of development.
> We presented the details in our paper at the 
#### A look under the hood: Cross-platform development with Flutter
The cross-platform framework Flutter was used to implement the APEROL frontend. Unlike other technologies, Flutter relies on its own widget library with replicas of the respective platform-native UI components. This gives Flutter full control over the rendering of the UI – regardless of the platform and its version. The tweaking of existing widgets is also quick, and custom widgets can be created by declaration with almost limitless possibilities.
This made Flutter ideal for the time-efficient as well as high-quality implementation of the APEROL Custom UI. On the backend, the app accesses a complex system of cloud-based algorithms for route planning (PSItms) and traffic simulation (MATSim) via an interface specified together with the research partners.
#### The home stretch: System test in real traffic with Wizard-of-Oz vehicle
After various workshops, evaluations and iterations of the apps, APEROL entered the home stretch – with a summative evaluation of the overall on-demand system in real road traffic in Aachen and Saarbrücken. The goal was to evaluate not only the user interfaces, but also the backend and route planning components in particular. A conventional vehicle (with driver) was used for this. But in order to still give the study participants the feeling of automated travel during the test drives, we implemented a Wizard-of-Oz vehicle setup.
The participants were provided in advance with the Companion App for download via Microsoft AppCenter. Our colleagues from Ergosign in Saarbrücken were able to book any two journeys on-demand on the trial days in March 2021 – for example, from home to work (in compliance with appropriate hygiene concepts due to the ongoing pandemic). In order to also examine the importance of passenger information displays in the interior, the participants received information about the course of the journey via the passenger information app during one of the two journeys, but not during the other.

A usual morning at a care home in Germany: Care staff use their tablet to document a resident’s health status. At the same time, they get a notification on their smartwatch: a resident in the next room has fallen! A colleague quickly comes to the man’s aid and checks whether everything is alright.

The “Digital Companion for Intelligent Advice and Interactive Experience” research project - or DiCo for short - is about tackling these problems and supporting care facilities through the systematic and participative introduction of technology. An AI-based assistance system guides the facility through the four phases of the digital transformation process. In the “orientation and sensitization” phase, employees are sensitized for digital transformation and a digitization strategy is developed. In the “analysis and planning” phase, the facility’s needs and specific requirements are analyzed. Based on this, DiCo then suggests suitable technologies and presents the pros and cons along with training requirements. In the last two phases, DiCo supports the care facility in introducing and, finally, evaluating suitable technologies.
DiCo offers care facilities long-term added value.

Around 1.8 million people live with dementia in Germany []. With approximately 445,000 new cases each year, this number is steadily increasing. The majority of these individuals are cared for at home by family members — a task that is emotionally demanding, time-consuming, and full of challenges []. 
This is precisely where the research project eDEM-CONNECT, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung), comes in: it aims to support family caregivers with a digital platform. Ergosign was involved as the UX partner in this project and demonstrates how human-centered design can concretely help in challenging life situations.
#### Putting individual care at the heart of digital design
The eDEM-CONNECT platform offers three core functions: a chatbot for individual questions, a practice-oriented knowledge portal, and a search function for regional support services. The idea is that family caregivers should be able to find information and assistance easily and based on their needs — especially for behavioral issues such as restlessness or aggression.
While the chatbot enables caregivers to get answers to individual questions, the knowledge portal provides practical information in the form of articles. Through the search function, caregivers can quickly find appropriate support services such as day care, care groups, or self-help groups — for both people with dementia and themselves.
#### UX at the core: empathize, create, validate
Ergosign took responsibility for UX design, research, prototyping, visual design, and testing in the project. Our approach: only those who understand the target group can create a truly helpful application. Therefore, we analyzed interviews with family caregivers and created validated personas based on these — including, for example, Britta (see illustration), who cares for her father with dementia. These personas gave us deep insights into individual life realities and caregiving challenges.
#### From caregiving journey to tested prototype
Using the personas, we developed a care journey to capture the changing needs over the course of the illness. It maps typical stress points and information requirements along the different stages of dementia — from the initial diagnosis to advanced care dependency. This structured perspective helped us derive targeted UX measures — such as intuitive navigation, appropriate content for specific phases, or quick access to regional support services.
The result was a prototype specifically tailored to the needs of the older target group — inclusive design was an integral part from the beginning. Since many users have age-related impairments like visual weaknesses, we placed special emphasis on clear contrasts, easily readable fonts, generous controls, and intuitive navigation. To continuously improve usability and user experience, the prototype was tested in two iterations with the target group. The collected feedback was directly incorporated into further development — resulting in an application concept that truly meets the everyday needs of family caregivers and people with dementia.
#### Emotions meet ethics — tactful design 
Caring for a person with dementia is associated with many emotions. This emotional aspect was incorporated into all phases of the concept. In workshops at the Evangelical University of Nuremberg, ethical questions were discussed, such as: How much can a chatbot do? Where is human support needed? Our design approach therefore focused on building trust. A warm color scheme, clear language, and relatable examples are intended to facilitate access.
#### Chatbot with responsibility
Special attention was given to developing the chatbot. Although it provides low-threshold help, it reaches its limits with emotional topics. Usability tests showed that many users are skeptical and desire human support for sensitive questions. Our insight: digital tools must take the needs of the target group seriously, not only technically but also ethically. A possible future development is a targeted handover to professional counseling centers.
#### Conclusion: UX design as a bridge to better quality of life
eDEM-CONNECT shows how UX and inclusive design can be used deliberately to create digital solutions for sensitive and complex life situations. The platform was designed to intuitively, accessibly, and emotionally support family caregivers of people with dementia. Through comprehensive research, iterative usability testing, and mindful handling of the topic of dementia, a prototype was created that convinces both functionally and empathetically. With a clear information structure, legible typography, high contrast, and simple navigation, eDEM-CONNECT is an example of how human-centered design in healthcare can deliver more than just attractive interfaces — it can provide real added value in everyday life.

The collected feedback was directly incorporated into further development — resulting in an application concept that truly meets the everyday needs of family caregivers and people with dementia.
#### Emotions meet ethics — tactful design 
Caring for a person with dementia is associated with many emotions. This emotional aspect was incorporated into all phases of the concept. In workshops at the Evangelical University of Nuremberg, ethical questions were discussed, such as: How much can a chatbot do? Where is human support needed? Our design approach therefore focused on building trust. A warm color scheme, clear language, and relatable examples are intended to facilitate access.
#### Chatbot with responsibility
Special attention was given to developing the chatbot. Although it provides low-threshold help, it reaches its limits with emotional topics. Usability tests showed that many users are skeptical and desire human support for sensitive questions. Our insight: digital tools must take the needs of the target group seriously, not only technically but also ethically. A possible future development is a targeted handover to professional counseling centers.
#### Conclusion: UX design as a bridge to better quality of life
eDEM-CONNECT shows how UX and inclusive design can be used deliberately to create digital solutions for sensitive and complex life situations. The platform was designed to intuitively, accessibly, and emotionally support family caregivers of people with dementia. Through comprehensive research, iterative usability testing, and mindful handling of the topic of dementia, a prototype was created that convinces both functionally and empathetically. With a clear information structure, legible typography, high contrast, and simple navigation, eDEM-CONNECT is an example of how human-centered design in healthcare can deliver more than just attractive interfaces — it can provide real added value in everyday life.

For many companies, ensuring digital accessibility represents an unclear hurdle because of lack of experience or personal connections. What do you need to do if you want to engage with this topic – or the laws surrounding it?
In order to find and remove barriers to accessibility, we first need personal experience with accessibility and inclusion. Learning by doing. Sounds like a long process. When we’re learning something, we often think: “If I’d known that earlier, I would be in a much better position.”
Today we can make this wish come true – without a time machine. Below are answers to some questions I asked myself when I first started learning about accessibility. These answers, which come from several years of deep experience in the field of inclusive design, are intended to accelerate the learning process for readers.
#### How many people does it take to screw in an accessible light bulb?
Screens consist of a lot of lights and are often the access point for our daily digital lives. How do we ensure that as many people as possible have this access?
We can, for example, increase the contrast so people with poor eyesight can also see the information. We’re concerned that some people can’t see these lights, so we offer alternatives. Or we might find that people with intellectual disabilities can perceive the light but, depending on the structure, they might not understand the information behind it. The individual measures for addressing these issues might seem simple. But they only work if they’re seen in context and with the involvement of all users.
So, regarding the light-bulb question: We need a lot of people – in order to determine whether the light is actually broken and whether some people would prefer to have a better speaker or instructions.
#### I’m heading out on the road to greater digital accessibility. What should I pack in my suitcase?
As you can see from the first question, accessibility has a lot to do with mindset. Accessibility isn’t something you can just work through like a checklist.
But with that in mind, here’s a checklist of things that can help on the road to greater digital accessibility:
  * Mindset of collaborative design, partnership and openness.
  * Conversations with friends, family, acquaintances, at work or in public. Many disabilities are invisible. They might only become clear through conversations in an open and positive environment.
  * Try using simulations – not the kind in the Matrix, but simulations of disabilities. They can help you better understand people’s different abilities (e.g. visual impairment filters, screen reading software, contrast calculator, dyslexia simulation).
  * Plan specific steps toward accessibility: Implementing measures after developing applications and services is usually more complicated than doing things right from the outset.
  * You also need the understanding that checklists aren’t enough because they are never complete. Requirements and technology, norms, and the technical state of art change regularly and we have to adapt.

#### What are the barriers to barrier-free accessibility?
This can be an intimidating topic and may put some people on the defensive. We’ve all heard people say: “We don’t need that! We don’t have any users with disabilities.” It’s sometimes difficult to convince people here. But it often turns out that this assumption is mistaken and that they just haven’t discussed the issues with their users.
So what should you do if you really don’t have any users with disabilities? Then you might be missing a huge opportunity! No project should voluntarily or out of ignorance exclude so many people and give up 15% of the market. After all, greater inclusion also means greater potential for success.
Presentation of 4 phases from exclusion to separation and integration to inclusion. Greater inclusion results in societal, social and economic added value, since all people can interact with each other in the same context without hurdles.
This social topic is often met with open arms, and we’re happy go into concrete implementation with support.
#### Do I need to worry about lawsuits from accessibility laws?
The rules of the BITV Regulation, which regulates the implementation of accessible digital services, has been in force for public bodies for several years.
A similarly functioning regulation with the abbreviation BFSGV will apply to the private sector starting in 2025. These rules are meant to ensure products are easier to understand and use. That’s a win-win for everyone. If the rules aren’t implemented in time, penalties can be imposed by lawyers, supervisory bodies, or even class-action lawsuits, as is the case with the GDPR data protection. That is why it’s advisable to start implementing the requirements in good time, as these can’t just be “added on” like a GDPR privacy policy.

#### What if I don’t know any people with disabilities, and I don’t know what their needs might be?
It is important that the needs of users with and without disabilities are taken into account. Nobody should be left to handle the implementation alone. People with disabilities cannot make every product and service in the world accessible on their own. This requires the kind of user-centered processes that usability experts are familiar with.
The fear that “I don’t have any disabilities myself, so I can’t do anything in this area” is completely unfounded. That would be like thinking that only pregnant women can develop products for pregnant women. That doesn’t make any sense either.
#### I’m convinced. Now how do I convince others?
  1. Set a good example and develop with accessibility in mind!
  2. Convince other decision makers of the benefits: These include social inclusion, usability optimization, legal certainty, market expansion, SEO optimization and many more.
  3. Delve deeper into the topic together with experts and users. This will help you determine what actually needs to be done. We’re happy to support you here.
  4. Share content about accessibility to make more people aware of it.
  5. Support accessibility by purchasing inclusive products.

It is becoming more common for software to be created in cross-functional teams that combine concept, design and development. These teams use their knowledge of a range of areas and combine this with agile and lean working methods to lead their project towards success.
The following article analyzes exactly how agile and lean approaches impact user experience design.
#### Agile Product Development: The Approach
Agile development is based on two fundamental concepts:
  * Software is developed iteratively.
Each iteration becomes a kind of mini project that delivers a complete product increment. The increment is planned, designed, implemented, integrated and tested “in one” and the code for each increment complies with the final desired quality. Depending on the team, an iteration takes two to four weeks.
  * Software is developed collaboratively.
All team members - regardless of their roles - work together to design, implement and test the increment. The individual team members have less specialization than in classic project approaches: so Developers also actively test and work on the product’s specifications, for example.


To plan product increments, agile teams split up product functionality into “user stories” that can be used to create a product backlog. Each iteration is therefore the implementation of a user story from the product backlog.
#### Agile Development: Challenges for UX Designers
This agile concept was developed without any focus on user experience design. It is therefore usually difficult for UX Designers to integrate into agile teams. The following are the two most important reasons:
  * Different methods of working.
User Experience Designers usually design the user interface using user scenarios. These describe an application case from the user’s perspective and contain a different level of detail than user stories. In contrast, user stories don’t contain any application cases from the user’s perspective, rather describe a range of individual functions down to the smallest detail. Good user experience design cannot, however, be developed from separate user stories that don’t interact.
  * Different scheduling.
As iterations take around two to four weeks, the team is unable to effectively plan and carry out user research activities for the selected function. This alone could take up the whole timeframe for the iteration - if not considerably more - and so impact the planning and implementation period intended for the next increment.


#### Agile Development and UX: Solutions
Cross-functional teams can, of course, still work together agilely, as there are practicable solutions for both challenges:
Example of a User Story Map
  * Different methods of working.
In his book „
  * Different scheduling.
There are several solutions for the second problem.
    * Front-loaded sprints.
    * Iteration Zero.
    * Dual-Track-Agile. 


We were able to prove that these methods are suitable for even large projects in the [Aviatar project with Lufthansa Technik](https://ergosign.de/en/work/case-studies/lufthansa-technik/), as we were able to use lean methods and work together with the customer in accordance with lean principles.

## Design principles for sustainable innovation
Our environment faces significant challenges – pollution, climate change, and resource scarcity. Despite increasing awareness of sustainability, actions to address the environmental crisis remain largely inadequate.
At Ergosign, we recognize the urgency to act and are committed to contributing to the solution of these global challenges as a collective of designers and developers. Therefore, an internal team of colleagues was assembled to evaluate these challenges from a UX and development perspective. We aim to understand the environmental impact of our work so that we can develop innovative solutions for our clients.
The result are the six design principles for integrating sustainability throughout the entire design process. These principles ensure that ecological and social impacts are considered from the outset. In addition to promoting sustainability awareness within our company, the six principles also serve as a guide for other companies seeking more environmentally friendly design solutions.
#### Principle 1: Shift to systems-centricity
The first principle is about recognizing the multidimensional impacts of digital products on society and the environment. Methods like the system-centric design canvas make these impacts visible.
#### Principle 2: Build to last
The second principle emphasizes the importance of designing products that remain relevant in the long term and reduce electronic waste. Methods like holistic future wheels help anticipate long-term consequences.
#### Principle 3: Reduce digital waste 
Principle three aims to minimize the resource consumption of digital products. Sustainable web design practices reduce the carbon footprint through decreased data usage.
#### Principle 4: Empower all users 
The focus of the fourth principle is to design products that are accessible to all users, aiming to eliminate biases and empower marginalized communities.
#### Principle 5: Enable sustainable behaviors 
Principle 5 promotes positive behavior changes through targeted design strategies. Thus, sustainable innovation should occur not only at the product level but also at the behavioral level. It involves creating products that support sustainable behavior and encourage users to make environmentally friendly decisions.
#### Principle 6: Act collaboratively and individually 
The sixth principle highlights that collective problem solving and individual responsibility are crucial for successful systemic change. It emphasizes that each individual should take responsibility and actively contribute to change.
#### Embedding the principles in the design process 
The principles can be applied in various phases of the design process, from early planning to implementation.
In conclusion, the importance of UX design in promoting sustainability goals is steadily increasing. The six principles illustrate the impact of design decisions and raise awareness of human and non-human needs. Moreover, their flexible application can measurably reduce emissions and resource consumption. Future research will further evaluate the effectiveness of these principles.

## Design principles for sustainable innovation
Our environment faces significant challenges – pollution, climate change, and resource scarcity. Despite increasing awareness of sustainability, actions to address the environmental crisis remain largely inadequate.
At Ergosign, we recognize the urgency to act and are committed to contributing to the solution of these global challenges as a collective of designers and developers. Therefore, an internal team of colleagues was assembled to evaluate these challenges from a UX and development perspective. We aim to understand the environmental impact of our work so that we can develop innovative solutions for our clients.
The result are the six design principles for integrating sustainability throughout the entire design process. These principles ensure that ecological and social impacts are considered from the outset. In addition to promoting sustainability awareness within our company, the six principles also serve as a guide for other companies seeking more environmentally friendly design solutions.
#### Principle 1: Shift to systems-centricity
The first principle is about recognizing the multidimensional impacts of digital products on society and the environment. Methods like the system-centric design canvas make these impacts visible.
#### Principle 2: Build to last
The second principle emphasizes the importance of designing products that remain relevant in the long term and reduce electronic waste. Methods like holistic future wheels help anticipate long-term consequences.
#### Principle 3: Reduce digital waste 
Principle three aims to minimize the resource consumption of digital products. Sustainable web design practices reduce the carbon footprint through decreased data usage.
#### Principle 4: Empower all users 
The focus of the fourth principle is to design products that are accessible to all users, aiming to eliminate biases and empower marginalized communities.
#### Principle 5: Enable sustainable behaviors 
Principle 5 promotes positive behavior changes through targeted design strategies. Thus, sustainable innovation should occur not only at the product level but also at the behavioral level. It involves creating products that support sustainable behavior and encourage users to make environmentally friendly decisions.
#### Principle 6: Act collaboratively and individually 
The sixth principle highlights that collective problem solving and individual responsibility are crucial for successful systemic change. It emphasizes that each individual should take responsibility and actively contribute to change.
#### Embedding the principles in the design process 
The principles can be applied in various phases of the design process, from early planning to implementation.
In conclusion, the importance of UX design in promoting sustainability goals is steadily increasing. The six principles illustrate the impact of design decisions and raise awareness of human and non-human needs. Moreover, their flexible application can measurably reduce emissions and resource consumption. Future research will further evaluate the effectiveness of these principles.

The energy transition is one of the greatest challenges of our time, requiring a fundamental shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. While technological advancements in smart grids, decentralized energy generation, and energy storage are crucial, good user experience (UX) design plays an equally important role.
These innovations can only reach their full potential if they are user-friendly. Ultimately, people need to understand how the various systems interconnect, how they function, and what impact their actions have. UX design ensures that energy providers and their customers can use these new systems effectively, efficiently, and intuitively.
After examining the UX challenges, we will highlight the key stakeholders and their needs.
## **Challenges and potential from a UX perspective**
#### **1. Growth of renewable energy**
In 2024, renewable energy sources account for almost 60% of global energy production - a record-breaking milestone. This growth is driven by advancements in solar, wind, and hydro power, as well as increased investments in energy storage solutions such as batteries and hydrogen technology.
The rise of renewable energy leads to volatility in energy supply, as solar and wind production fluctuate depending on weather conditions. This is where the effective integration of advanced energy storage and smart demand management systems comes into play, helping to balance fluctuations.
The challenge lies in designing human-centered and intuitive systems and dashboards that provide real-time insights for both energy providers and consumers, allowing them to compensate for fluctuating energy availability.
> Hydrogen plays a key role in the energy transition. In the [WAVEH2](https://ergosign.de/en/work/wave-h2) project, Ergosign developed a digital platform that makes complex hydrogen processes visually accessible. WAVEH2 aims to establish itself as a crucial tool for the energy supply of the factory of the future, supporting the industry on its path toward a sustainable future.
#### **2. Making energy and load management user-friendly**
Efficient energy management is essential for balancing supply and demand, reducing waste, and ensuring grid stability. Smart meters and smart grids have become indispensable tools, providing vast amounts of real-time data. However, many users struggle to understand and effectively utilize this information. An intuitive user experience can make all the difference.
  * **Smart meters** provide real-time consumption data to both consumers and energy providers, enabling dynamic pricing and personalized energy-saving recommendations. Consumers gain full control over their consumption and, ultimately, their bills.
  * **Smart grids** digitally manage energy supply networks using sensors, automation, and data analysis to ensure efficient, reliable, and sustainable electricity distribution. Intuitive interfaces for consumers, grid operators, and energy providers help optimize energy flow, integrate renewable energy, and reduce grid issues.


**Challenges:** Although these technologies improve efficiency, many users struggle with complex interfaces and data interpretation. Effective UX design can help: well-designed digital solutions grant access to crucial data, while clear visualizations make data interpretation easier. Additionally, it is essential to ensure these solutions are as accessible as possible so that individuals with disabilities or temporary impairments can also use them.
#### **3. Decentralization of energy systems**
The energy landscape is rapidly shifting from centralized power plants to decentralized energy networks, where households, businesses, and communities generate their own energy through solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage. Our customers, [**Maingau**](https://ergosign.de/en/work/maingau-energie/) and [**Yippie**](https://ergosign.de/en/work/yippie/) , have already recognized this as an opportunity. In addition to green energy and gas contracts, their online shops allow customers to purchase balcony power plants, solar panels, and other products for personal use.
  * **Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading** enables consumers to sell excess energy back to the grid or directly to other users.
  * **Microgrids** are becoming increasingly important as they enhance local energy resilience and reduce dependence on large-scale infrastructure.


**Challenges:** Managing decentralized networks requires seamless digital platforms that provide real-time insights, easy-to-use interfaces, and automation for transaction processing, energy flows, and grid stability. This is where a **Digital Experience Platform (DXP)** comes into play, perfectly integrating various components to connect grid operators, energy providers, and consumers within a unified, intuitive environment.
A DXP enables:
  * Transparent transaction processing, optimizing energy exchange and providing personalized insights into consumption and feed-in.
  * AI-powered forecasting and automation to enhance efficiency and trust in decentralized energy markets.
  * A user-friendly dashboard experience to increase acceptance and usability.


## **Key stakeholders and their needs**
#### **1. Energy providers**
Utilities must balance energy generation with demand while integrating renewable sources. At the same time, customers expect comprehensive service offerings, transparent pricing, and flexibility. Since switching providers has never been easier, a seamless user experience has become the most important tool for customer retention.
**Key needs:**
  * **Detailed consumption analytics** to optimize distribution and prevent grid overload.
  * **AI-powered forecasts** for weather and demand patterns to allocate energy more intelligently.
  * **User engagement tools** that encourage energy-saving behaviors and incentivize shifting consumption from peak hours to lower-demand periods.


**Challenges:** Without clear data visualization and predictive analytics, energy providers risk inefficiencies and customer dissatisfaction.
#### **2. Manufacturers and technology providers**
To support the energy transition, manufacturers must deliver solutions that ensure seamless interoperability across various platforms.
**Biggest challenges:**
  * **Standardized communication protocols** that enable compatibility between smart systems like meters, grids, and home automation.
  * **Scalable and modular technology** that adapts to changing regulations and market demands.
  * **User-friendly interfaces** for installers and technicians to simplify system implementation.


**Challenges:** A fragmented ecosystem of proprietary technologies complicates integration. Effective UX strategies can unify platforms and improve user adoption.
Human-centered UX design addresses these challenges by tailoring solutions to user needs, bridging gaps in fragmented ecosystems. Our clients, including [**KNX**](https://ergosign.de/en/work/knx/) , [**Stadtwerke Düsseldorf**](https://ergosign.de/en/work/stadtwerke-duesseldorf/) , and [**BSH Hausgeräte**](https://ergosign.de/en/work/bsh) , have trusted our expertise for years.
#### **3. Consumers**
End users are becoming increasingly proactive in managing their energy consumption. They seek providers that offer real-time data, allowing them to optimize consumption and control costs through dynamic pricing models and transparent billing.
**Challenges:** Consumers often face overly complex dashboards, unclear consumption (and cost) tracking, and a lack of transparency in energy tariffs - leading to frustration and lower adoption rates.
A **DXP** can help by creating a centralized, personalized, and user-friendly digital environment that makes complex energy information understandable and easily accessible.
**Benefits of a DXP:**
  * **Personalized dashboards** that display only relevant information (e.g., real-time consumption, savings potential, or tariffs).
  * **AI-powered recommendations** that improve price transparency and tariff comparisons.
  * **Omni-channel experiences** ensure seamless usability across web, app, and smart home devices.
  * **Gamification and interactive guidance** to encourage conscious energy management.
  * **Community and support** through forums, FAQ, and smart chatbots for 24/7 assistance.


In short: A DXP makes complex energy management understandable, improves user experience and loyalty, and increases acceptance of digital energy management solutions.
#### **Conclusion**
A user-centered and holistic approach that considers the entire ecosystem, including all stakeholders and their needs, is essential for a successful energy transition. UX design can help in many ways: energy providers can offer their services more efficiently, users gain greater transparency and control over their consumption, and the adoption of sustainable energy practices becomes easier.

Would you trust a machine learning system to calculate the best treatment for you?   
  
This question might sound a little futuristic, or even like science fiction, to some. The use of machine learning in healthcare is, however, the core of the IMEDALytics research project, in which we’re joining forces with Philips GmbH (Innovative Technologies department), the intensive care department at the Uniklinik Aachen, RWTH Aachen and Trier University.
#### Starting situation
In order to explain what specifically is being researched under the IMEDALytics project, let us briefly explain the current treatment situation. On intensive care wards, care staff must ensure that patients’ fluid balance is stable alongside their many other treatment tasks (such as administering medication). Any bodily fluids lost by the patient must be compensated for quickly. This treatment is known as “volume substitution”.
> The aim of this therapy is to restore a normal blood volume to improve circulation. The hereby increased oxygen supply in the tissue means better overall organ function.
Establishing the correct dose isn’t easy: doctors and care staff must work out the optimal indication, a suitable infusion solution and the tailored application of the right dose. If they don’t manage this balancing act, the result can be undesired long-term consequences such as more serious care or long-term ventilation.
#### What is IMEDALytics?
The aim of the research project is to develop a digital system that improves medical staffing and the quality of care received by intensive care patients. The system should also support ambulance staff in estimating each individual patient’s risk level and further treatment.  
Current guidelines are to be combined with innovative machine data analysis technology. This process consists of multiple steps:
  * Medically relevant guidelines that are only available in text format are semantically collected using natural language processing approaches and integrated into the recommendation.
  * We combine individual patient status data with treatment path templates based on huge patient data sets.
  * The IMEDALytics system learns and constantly generates new knowledge from collected data fed to it.
  * In future, this newly attained knowledge can be used to develop new, data-supported processes to create evidence-based guidelines.


Specifically, this means that the care staff using the IMEDALytics system will be provided with qualified suggestions for the patient’s optimal treatment. The final decision is always made by a human.
> Doctors and nursing staff have highly specialized knowledge, lots of experience and precisely learned routines. Machine intelligence can evaluate huge amounts of data, identify complex interactions and provide precise recommendations. Using this kind of statistical analyses in healthcare is a tempting prospect, and the potential to identify hidden patterns and support the treatment of patients is great.
#### What is our role in the project?
Our task? The human-oriented design of an efficient, effective, satisfactory interface to comply with ISO norm 9241-210 and 62366.  
Specifically, this means that we are conceptualizing and designing a graphical user interface (GUI) that will allow the user to use the whole of the IMEDALytics system - including algorithmic recommendations.  
The medical context comes with particular challenges for technical systems and their user interfaces - and, therefore, us. It is essential that the system seamlessly integrates into everyday life at the clinic and the processes of medical staff so that it is actually seen as helpful and used in their busy work days. A high degree of usability and a positive user experience are essential.  
Users are also under pressure and stress. Mistakes in treatment can have grave consequences but staff are left with very little time to think things through.
#### Essential for the system: use context
In order to do these design requirements justice, it’s essential to glean a deep understanding of all user groups. Through intensive interviews and job shadowing, we are creating a multifaceted view of staff’s everyday lives and the various treatment options for volume substitution.
One of the first challenges arose right at the beginning: current guidelines and algorithmic recommendations have to be visualized so that they accommodate individual user preferences. Then these need information that varies in terms of complexity and depth:
  1. For diagnostics (retrospective) and
  2. Suggestions for treatment, in parallel to the risk assessment (prognostic)
  3. Easy-to-understand information on current monitoring


In addition, it must be considered where interaction with the system can take place naturally and which user group the system takes into consideration. Again, the key here is that doctors have the opportunity to enter feedback into the system manually.
#### Summary
It is our aim to optimally complement human skills with the possibilities offered by a machine learning system. Over the three-year period, we will be working with our project partners to create an IT-based decision-making support system for volume substitution in intensive care patients.

Christine Gottlieb
07/07/2025 • 5 minutes reading time
Digital services in the public sector face unique challenges: diverse target audiences, complex regulatory requirements, and many legacy IT systems. At the same time, user expectations are rising—demanding accessibility, performance, and intuitive usability across all devices. Traditional, monolithic content management systems frequently reach their limits under these conditions.
###  What is a Headless CMS—and why Strapi?
A headless CMS tailored to the public sector offers a future-proof alternative. Decoupling backend from frontend, enables greater flexibility in development, easier integration into existing system landscapes, and a consistent user experience across multiple digital touchpoints.
At Ergosign, we use Strapi in projects where editorial workflows and UX are equally important—particularly where content must be secure, accessible, and performant. These benefits are especially apparent in the public sector: Strapi not only enables technical efficiency but also allows content to be tailored for different audiences and platforms—from barrier-free websites to specialized portals.
The following two use cases show how we partnered with public organizations to build solutions that set new standards in both design and technology—using Strapi as the foundation. Especially in UX-centric projects, Strapi proves how a headless CMS can seamlessly connect editorial processes and user experience.
###  Use case 1: Centralized content management for website & kiosks in Haßfurt
In collaboration with the City of Haßfurt, we tackled a common challenge faced by public sector organizations: delivering consistent, up-to-date, and accessible content across multiple platforms—specifically, the city's municipal website and a network of digital information kiosks installed throughout the area.
Using Strapi as a headless CMS, we established a centralized system to manage both channels. Content is created once and tailored to the unique requirements of each platform. For example, the website features a full three-level navigation structure and advanced full-text search, while the kiosks are designed for quick access with a simplified single-level menu and predefined topic categories.
To enhance functionality and user experience, we integrated two specialized services directly into Strapi:
  * Thumbor automatically processes images—resizing, cropping, and converting them into modern formats like WEBP, thus ensuring optimal performance across all devices.
  * Typesense, an AI-powered vector search engine, delivers highly relevant results even for semantically complex queries.


Strapi also proved highly effective for editorial workflows:
  * The “Draft + Publish” workflow enables editors to preview and test content before publishing.
  * The multilingual setup allows for customized layouts per language, which is crucial for serving a diverse community.
  * A granular permission system ensures that staff only access content relevant to their role.


Editorial efficiency is further improved through reusable content components: for instance, contact data is centrally managed and automatically updated wherever it appears—whether in the site footer, contact search, or individual pages. Thanks to a modular content architecture, new pages and content sections can be added easily—even after the initial project launch.
The City of Haßfurt chose Strapi based on its requirement for a powerful, open-source CMS that integrates well with existing infrastructure while offering a flexible, user-friendly editorial experience. Compared to proprietary headless CMS platforms, Strapi stood out for its openness, extensibility, and active developer community—delivering all key features without compromising usability or future scalability.
###  Use Case 2: Strapi as CMS & functional backend for the FichtelApp
A particularly dynamic use of Strapi can be found in the [FichtelApp](https://ergosign.de/en/work/fichtelapp)—a regional service app designed for the Fichtelgebirge in Bavaria. The app is for both residents and visitors, offering location-based information, events, services, and guidance.
Together with the project team, we implemented Strapi not only as a traditional CMS but as the core administrative platform for an entire digital ecosystem. The goal: make relevant content and services available seamlessly across platforms, including the app (iOS & Android) and a physical information kiosk.
Strapi enabled editorial teams to bring together diverse data sources—like tourism databases—within a single, intuitive interface. Content could be enhanced and prepared for publication without system breaks or switching between tools.
Strapi also became the functional backend for core features:
  * Push notifications are created directly in the CMS and sent to app users in a targeted, timely way, without third-party systems.
  * User management is fully integrated, allowing staff to create, block, or delete user profiles with fine-grained access control.


The project is built on a ""Single Source of Truth"" principle: all content is managed in one place and distributed to both the mobile app and the on-site kiosk. This ensures consistency, reduces editorial effort, and enables fast updates across channels.
At the heart of the app experience lies the ""Discovery Page""—a dynamic landing screen that can be fully customized via modular content blocks. Editors can easily swap out hero images, update text, or add tags with just a few clicks. This level of autonomy keeps the app fresh, engaging, and constantly evolving—without requiring developer input.
###  Conclusion: Headless CMS as a digital enabler for the public sector
These two projects clearly demonstrate how a modern headless CMS like Strapi can meet the specific demands of the public sector:
  * Centralized content governance with channel-specific output
  * Editorial autonomy without technical complexity
  * Modular, scalable architecture for long-term flexibility
  * Integration of external services such as image processing and intelligent search


As an open-source platform, Strapi offers the transparency and flexibility that many public institutions require. For Ergosign, it’s more than just a CMS—it’s a foundation for building human-centered, scalable digital services where content, design, and functionality work hand in hand.
With Strapi, we build digital platforms that aren’t just efficient to run—but built around people.
###  About Strapi
Strapi is a modern, JavaScript-based headless CMS that delivers content via APIs and is fully customizable. As an open-source solution, it gives developers complete control over the data structure, enables seamless integration into existing system landscapes, and supports flexible editorial workflows. Thanks to its modular architecture, Strapi is particularly well-suited for applications where content needs to be delivered across multiple channels in a performant and user-centric way – from websites and apps to digital information systems.

A particularly dynamic use of Strapi can be found in the [FichtelApp](https://ergosign.de/en/work/fichtelapp)—a regional service app designed for the Fichtelgebirge in Bavaria. The app is for both residents and visitors, offering location-based information, events, services, and guidance.
Together with the project team, we implemented Strapi not only as a traditional CMS but as the core administrative platform for an entire digital ecosystem. The goal: make relevant content and services available seamlessly across platforms, including the app (iOS & Android) and a physical information kiosk.
Strapi enabled editorial teams to bring together diverse data sources—like tourism databases—within a single, intuitive interface. Content could be enhanced and prepared for publication without system breaks or switching between tools.
Strapi also became the functional backend for core features:
  * Push notifications are created directly in the CMS and sent to app users in a targeted, timely way, without third-party systems.
  * User management is fully integrated, allowing staff to create, block, or delete user profiles with fine-grained access control.


The project is built on a ""Single Source of Truth"" principle: all content is managed in one place and distributed to both the mobile app and the on-site kiosk. This ensures consistency, reduces editorial effort, and enables fast updates across channels.
At the heart of the app experience lies the ""Discovery Page""—a dynamic landing screen that can be fully customized via modular content blocks. Editors can easily swap out hero images, update text, or add tags with just a few clicks. This level of autonomy keeps the app fresh, engaging, and constantly evolving—without requiring developer input.
###  Conclusion: Headless CMS as a digital enabler for the public sector
These two projects clearly demonstrate how a modern headless CMS like Strapi can meet the specific demands of the public sector:
  * Centralized content governance with channel-specific output
  * Editorial autonomy without technical complexity
  * Modular, scalable architecture for long-term flexibility
  * Integration of external services such as image processing and intelligent search


As an open-source platform, Strapi offers the transparency and flexibility that many public institutions require. For Ergosign, it’s more than just a CMS—it’s a foundation for building human-centered, scalable digital services where content, design, and functionality work hand in hand.
With Strapi, we build digital platforms that aren’t just efficient to run—but built around people.
###  About Strapi
Strapi is a modern, JavaScript-based headless CMS that delivers content via APIs and is fully customizable. As an open-source solution, it gives developers complete control over the data structure, enables seamless integration into existing system landscapes, and supports flexible editorial workflows. Thanks to its modular architecture, Strapi is particularly well-suited for applications where content needs to be delivered across multiple channels in a performant and user-centric way – from websites and apps to digital information systems.
A headless CMS tailored to the public sector offers a future-proof alternative. Decoupling backend from frontend, enables greater flexibility in development, easier integration into existing system landscapes, and a consistent user experience across multiple digital touchpoints.
At Ergosign, we use Strapi in projects where editorial workflows and UX are equally important—particularly where content must be secure, accessible, and performant. These benefits are especially apparent in the public sector: Strapi not only enables technical efficiency but also allows content to be tailored for different audiences and platforms—from barrier-free websites to specialized portals.
The following two use cases show how we partnered with public organizations to build solutions that set new standards in both design and technology—using Strapi as the foundation. Especially in UX-centric projects, Strapi proves how a headless CMS can seamlessly connect editorial processes and user experience.
In collaboration with the City of Haßfurt, we tackled a common challenge faced by public sector organizations: delivering consistent, up-to-date, and accessible content across multiple platforms—specifically, the city's municipal website and a network of digital information kiosks installed throughout the area.
Using Strapi as a headless CMS, we established a centralized system to manage both channels. Content is created once and tailored to the unique requirements of each platform. For example, the website features a full three-level navigation structure and advanced full-text search, while the kiosks are designed for quick access with a simplified single-level menu and predefined topic categories.
To enhance functionality and user experience, we integrated two specialized services directly into Strapi:
  * Thumbor automatically processes images—resizing, cropping, and converting them into modern formats like WEBP, thus ensuring optimal performance across all devices.
  * Typesense, an AI-powered vector search engine, delivers highly relevant results even for semantically complex queries.


Strapi also proved highly effective for editorial workflows:
  * The “Draft + Publish” workflow enables editors to preview and test content before publishing.
  * The multilingual setup allows for customized layouts per language, which is crucial for serving a diverse community.
  * A granular permission system ensures that staff only access content relevant to their role.


Editorial efficiency is further improved through reusable content components: for instance, contact data is centrally managed and automatically updated wherever it appears—whether in the site footer, contact search, or individual pages. Thanks to a modular content architecture, new pages and content sections can be added easily—even after the initial project launch.
The City of Haßfurt chose Strapi based on its requirement for a powerful, open-source CMS that integrates well with existing infrastructure while offering a flexible, user-friendly editorial experience. Compared to proprietary headless CMS platforms, Strapi stood out for its openness, extensibility, and active developer community—delivering all key features without compromising usability or future scalability.

### Trainee support for a corporate health management project
There are many cooking apps, but you probably haven't heard of Forx yet! While currently in the conceptual phase, this new recipe app promises a lot of fun and support for healthy nutrition of the Ergosign team. Laura Gül (Communication Manager) chatted with Rawad Malahafji (Trainee for Media Design) and Aline Tasch (People & Talent Administrator) what Forx is all about in an interview. 
LauraRawad, you designed and developed the app concept for Forx, as part of your training while Aline initiated this project. What does Forx stand for, and what is it about?
Rawad
Laura Where did the idea for Forx come from?
Aline
Since the event only took place at the Saarbrücken location, not all employees from our seven sites could benefit from it. It was important for us to change that and give all locations the opportunity to profit from this event. Naturally, we decided to digitalize the Cook&Learn. Initially, I had the idea to provide the dishes as recipe cards in our intranet. As our trainee in media design, Rawad supported me to ensure the recipe cards corresponded with our design guidelines. She suggested a digital, interactive prototype instead of recipe cards. I was immediately excited – after all, Ergosign is a digital agency, and that's how Forx was born.
A nutritionist chats to a group about healthy lunch options.
LauraWho was involved in this project, and what were the responsibilities of the team members?
Rawad
LauraWhat is the goal of Forx, and how do employees benefit from it?
Aline
Rawad
LauraWhat support and freedom do apprentices at Ergosign receive during such a project?
Rawad
In designing the prototype, I had a lot of freedom and could implement my ideas, for example, using AI in creating illustrations for the preparation section. My mentor and team manager were always there to provide guidance and regularly shared their ideas on design concepts and animation with me. Although it was a challenging project, I had a lot of fun with the implementation due to the fantastic support and the generally relaxed atmosphere at Ergosign. In summary, I can say that the project work taught me many important things for both my job and school, including patience, time management, and how to incorporate and implement feedback into a project.
Rawad presented her project at the end of February during a Lunch&Learn. The internal feedback was consistently positive. We are excited about the future of Forx and look forward to many new recipes. If you now feel inspired to cook, here's our favorite dish:

### Golly what an app!
#### The FichtelApp: A digital success story in the heart of the Fichtel Gebirge
The Fichtel Gebirge are known for their picturesque landscape and diverse recreational opportunities. With more than 70,000 residents, 17 municipalities, and 13 nature reserves, there are plenty of opportunities for a fulfilling life or a vacation – whether you're into sports, nature, or adventures. The ""Freiraum für Macher"" (Space for Makers) initiative was launched in 2018 to draw more attention to this region and attract qualified professionals, entrepreneurs, and families. It successfully qualified the Wunsiedel district as a model region for the Smart City initiative. A central part of this development is the FichtelApp, developed by Ergosign in close collaboration with the city of Wunsiedel.
#### The challenge: creating a digital representation of the Fichtel Gebirge
The initiative ""Freiraum für Macher"" had the goal of positioning the Fichtel Gebrige as a livable space for work, life, and tourism. Now, the entire Fichtel Gebirge fits into your pocket with the FichtelApp. Ergosign was tasked with developing an app that not only provides practical information but also conveys the unique lifestyle of the region. The focus was on a user-centered approach that ensured the needs and desires of users were considered from the start.
#### Omnichannel brand experience
The Wunsiedel district launched a successful campaign featuring Thomas Zeitler as ""Werner,"" the humorous ambassador of the Fichtel Gebrige. Having been born and bred in the Fichtel Gebrige, he didn't have to act much to authentically embody the feeling and quality of life in the region. Since the release of the app in July 2022, Werner has also been available digitally. This seamlessly transitions the campaign from the analog to the digital world: the app meets users at all touchpoints. In January 2024, ""Kristina"" joined as female support for Werner and the makers of the region. Her digital version in the app will, of course, also be included. 
#### Intuitive handling and innovative features 
The FichtelApp not only offers intuitive operation and clear structure but also exciting features such as augmented reality. By integrating gamification elements, user engagement with the app is increased while they playfully learn more about the region. The visual design of the app was carefully chosen to create a harmonious and natural atmosphere. Specially crafted illustrations foster a sense of connection with the Fichtel Gebrige and contribute to a unique user experience. Through the integration of community features, the FichtelApp strengthens cohesion and networking in the region. Users can join local interest groups and actively participate in shaping the app.
#### Where's the next loo? 
The charming Werner presents the app and its many features in a creative and hilarious promotional video. This helped make the video well-known far beyond the borders of the Fichtel Gebrige. The video refers to a small but important aspect of the app: the geographic location of public toilets. It's this attention to detail that makes the FichtelApp so unique and a prime example of a successful mobile tourism application. 
#### The community at the center: solidarity and exchange
A special feature of the FichtelApp is the integration of the local community. By allowing users to join various interest groups and contribute their own content, the app becomes a lively digital meeting place for locals and visitors alike. From hiking tips to culinary highlights to event notifications, the FichtelApp provides comprehensive insights into life in the Fichtel Gebrige. 
The FichtelApp is more than just a tourism app – it is a digital reflection of the region that promotes exchange, networking, and participation in the Fichtel Gebrige across generations. With additional digital products like the FichtelPodcast and the FichtelNewsletter, the Wunsiedel district consistently implements its vision of a future-proof and flexible region. The next step in realizing this vision is the introduction of the ""FichtelStelen"", another collaboration with Ergosign, which will be available at many public places in the region in the summer of 2024. The steles represent another touchpoint for the FichtelApp, fostering information flow and engagement with the app. 
#### A complete success: awards and positive feedback
Since its release in July 2022, the FichtelApp has garnered a steadily growing user base and received positive ratings. The app has now established itself as an indispensable tool for locals and tourists alike.
The FichtelApp is not only a success for the region but also an example of successful brand communication and digital innovation. It demonstrates how cooperation, user-centeredness, and engagement can create a vibrant community that makes the Fichtel Gebirge a place you simply must love. The awards received from various design awards are the icing on the cake of a thoroughly successful project.
If you are also interested in a successful digital strategy for your business, please feel free to contact us. We will support you in developing innovative and user-centered solutions, that effectively promote your goals.
> Since starting at Erghosign at the end of 2021, I have had the pleasure of accompanying the FichtelApp by creating content for social media, case studies, and awards. I am incredibly proud of how people connect with the app, how it enriches the community, and of all the successes the app has achieved.

How can designers help improve the care of patients in intensive care units? This is exactly the question we are addressing in the IMEDALytics research project.
In this article, we cover the significance of three context analyses that we carried out as part of this project — as well as the valuable knowledge we gained. Find out all the details surrounding problem assessment and project objectives in the first part of the article.
#### Understanding the system’s use context
So that we can guarantee a good user experience, we have to develop a comprehensive understanding of the intended user and the future system’s technical possibilities.
#### Contextual inquiries
After a scoping workshop with all project partners, we paid three visits to intensive care units at the University Hospital of Aachen and Dortmund Hospital. We were able to observe the everyday work across various intensive treatment units as well as accessing the medical expertise of the staff there — also our future users.
Contextual inquiries combine observations and interviews and are an essential part of this project for us as UX Designers. They offer us the unique opportunity to identify user contexts, users and important factors impacting healthcare professionals’ decisions and actions in their stressful working environments.
As well as this insight into real everyday work, the visits let us identify how we can integrate IMEDALytics into medical and nursing staff’s everyday life at the hospital so that the system actually provides support.
#### Learnings
1 Handovers
It was enlightening to observe that there are informal and formal information handovers as well as synchronized and asynchronized collaborations between members of staff. Shift handovers take place between
  * doctors and other doctors

  * nurses and other nurses


Additional consultations are spontaneous — particularly when a second opinion is required. During examinations, yet more information is exchanged and decisions made as a joint effort.
2 Role sharing
While doctors see their patients at relatively long intervals and decide the appropriate therapy, nursing staff see their patients more often so are responsible for monitoring their status as well as achieving targets. Their observations on patient condition and the success of assigned measures form part of the doctors’ decision-making processes.
3 Documentation: digital and analogue
During our visits to the two hospitals, we found out that the units we visited differed drastically in how information is documented using digital systems. Doctor’s orders, prescribed medications, treatments and other care instructions were simultaneously logged by doctors and nurses. In one clinic, this documentation was digital, while the other used standardized sheets of paper — this makes a major difference in the context of our project!
4 Workload and stress
Staff workloads deviate between weekdays as well as during the course of one day, depending on how many patients are in the unit and how critical their conditions are. Then there are factors such as a constantly high level of noise from medical devices. Many generate acoustic feedback even during less critical events. In addition to this stress, staff had to make repeated, sometimes lengthy trips between individual rooms and were rarely able to take breaks.
User Experience Map
#### Findings are established in personas
In order to condense the knowledge we gained as well as develop and contextualize important user characteristics and requirements, we created multiple personas. Personas illustrate hypothetical people to represent typical users. The generated personas are involved time and again throughout the course of the project. This lets us ensure that prospective users actually remain our focus. What’s more, personas facilitate targeted communication between all those involved in the project.
In some projects, creating just one persona is sufficient. Within the context of IMEDALytics, we differentiated between three groups that we categorized based on their different needs regarding the system:
  * Regular unit doctors
  * Nursing staff
  * Researching doctors


With the help of our personas, we are able to highlight how their needs differ.
Persona: Hanna Tolle, assistant doctorPersona: Peter Busch, nursing specialist
#### Impacts on our design
One desire very clearly crystalized during our contextual inquiries: Nurses and doctors want a decision support system (DSS) to support indication, risk assessment, choice of the right therapy and monitoring as well as therapy management. Furthermore, doctors in particular stressed how very important it is to make a system’s decisions transparent and easy to follow.
> “That would be a dream come true” (unit doctor).
The various sub-goals for future users resulting from the treatment phase and role (decision-making, implementation, review) form the framework for our DSS design.
Other than this, we came across contrasts that impact our design mission:
  1. A future system should combine the intelligence of machines and humans to guarantee the best possible care. An interactive system must also bring together the knowledge and skills of various people in a way that makes sense.
  2. Requirements and targets are greatly defined by the current context; while it is sometimes important to display decisions transparently and in a way that is easy to follow, other situations may make it important to portray the decision as efficiently as possible to avoid stress-related errors.


#### To sum it up
For meaningful, efficient UX design, it is essential to speak with future users and observe them in their everyday work environments. They will come up against real challenges and stressors that impact the users significantly.
Only when a design approach takes this into account — and provides a solution — can it be perceived as helpful. Especially when dealing with an extremely complex system such as IMEDALytics, presentation must comply with user needs for transparency and ease of understanding.

# IMEDALytics: Healthcare Machine Learning – Part 2
Annika Kaltenhauser
Dr. Verena Rheinstädter
22/02/2021 • 7 minutes reading time
How can designers help improve the care of patients in intensive care units? This is exactly the question we are addressing in the IMEDALytics research project.
In this article, we cover the significance of three context analyses that we carried out as part of this project — as well as the valuable knowledge we gained. Find out all the details surrounding problem assessment and project objectives in the first part of the article.
#### Understanding the system’s use context
So that we can guarantee a good user experience, we have to develop a comprehensive understanding of the intended user and the future system’s technical possibilities.
#### Contextual inquiries
After a scoping workshop with all project partners, we paid three visits to intensive care units at the University Hospital of Aachen and Dortmund Hospital. We were able to observe the everyday work across various intensive treatment units as well as accessing the medical expertise of the staff there — also our future users.
Contextual inquiries combine observations and interviews and are an essential part of this project for us as UX Designers. They offer us the unique opportunity to identify user contexts, users and important factors impacting healthcare professionals’ decisions and actions in their stressful working environments.
As well as this insight into real everyday work, the visits let us identify how we can integrate IMEDALytics into medical and nursing staff’s everyday life at the hospital so that the system actually provides support.
#### Learnings
1 Handovers
It was enlightening to observe that there are informal and formal information handovers as well as synchronized and asynchronized collaborations between members of staff. Shift handovers take place between
  * doctors and other doctors
  * nurses and doctors and
  * nurses and other nurses


Additional consultations are spontaneous — particularly when a second opinion is required. During examinations, yet more information is exchanged and decisions made as a joint effort.

### FichtelApp animations for the big screen
After the huge success of the FichtelApp, our app is now making the leap to the big screen, specifically on 8 digital kiosks that will be found in the Wunsiedel district starting at the end of 2024. The special feature of these kiosks is that they are interactive, making them accessible for everyone to use.
Just like with the app for mobile phones or tablets, a digital Werner invites users to participate. He guides people through the menu of the digital kiosk and helps them navigate the application. Various animations for Werner were designed using Rive, making the experience with the kiosk particularly welcoming.
In this insights article, we want to explain in detail what the animation with Rive is all about and how the implementation with Flutter works.
A spotlight on Werner
Werner is essentially the mascot of the Fichtelgebirge — both in reality and in his digital version. This creates a high recognition value, even far beyond the borders of the Fichtelgebirge. People know Werner from the app, promotional films, print, and online media, so it was clear that Werner had to be on the kiosk as well.
He acts as a quick start guide, and after the first interaction with the kiosk, the character goes through various states as he shrinks down, but he never disappears completely. Werner is always available and serves as an anchor point for people who are not very familiar with interacting with a digital screen. This simplifies and makes navigation of the application more welcoming. By using Rive for the animation design, the transitions feel particularly smooth, and the movements appear natural.
[More on the success story of the fichtelapp](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/fichtelapp-erfolgsgeschichte)
A spotlight on Rive 
Rive is particularly well-suited for animations because it offers endless possibilities for high-detail animations. Additionally, Rive makes the handover to the developers easy. The Rive animation software, like Figma, is primarily a browser application, making it flexible and usable across different devices.
Developers receive a detailed handover with an animation preview, so they can understand exactly how the animation should behave and test it independently. However, design and development work hand in hand with Rive. The design team can do a lot of preparatory work and predefine the states. The development team can initialize the triggers provided by Rive, giving them full control over the animation.
[More on app development at ergosign](https://ergosign.de/en/services/mobile-app-development)
Rive X Flutter integration
Both tools are regularly used by us, both separately and in combination. Rive animations frequently find their place on our website as well as in client projects, inviting interaction or creating a 'Wow' effect. Flutter, on the other hand, has established itself as an industry standard in app development.
Flutter allows pixel-perfect development with full control over the appearance of elements. The software is based on a single, cross-platform codebase, allowing the application to run on Android, iOS, and, with minimal adjustments, on desktop and web platforms as well.
Both tools are cross-platform by nature. The widget-based architecture of Flutter and the user-friendly APIs of Rive ensure that animations can be integrated into an app quickly and efficiently.
#### Are you also looking for an app solution that excites customers and stakeholders? Then, a custom-made app with tailor-made animations might be just what you need! Get in touch with us — we look forward to an initial conversation!

Nadine Schlicker
02/05/2019 • 4 minutes reading time
The medical and healthcare sector is full of challenges that workers are confronted with each and every day. Together with our partners, we are working on the GamOR project. This aims to tackle one particular challenge that is making it difficult for nursing staff to organize their work and private lives: shift planning.
The acronym GamOR stands for Game of Roster - a fitting name, as we approach rostering from a playful perspective. In the GamOR project, we are developing a collaborative planning application for nursing staff that tackles the main issues in shift planning: a lack of transparency and fairness in scheduling decisions. GamOR offers a mathematically founded and understandable solution that encourages nursing staff to organize themselves as well as promoting work-life balance.
> The book „Digitalisierung in der Pflege” (“Digitization in care”) is now published. It goes into more detail about GamOR. Chapter 8 is entitled as „Nachhaltige Motivation durch wohlbefindensorientierte Gestaltung” (“Sustainable motivation through well-being oriented design”) and is available as a 
erhältlich im Springer Verlag
#### A constraint-based algorithm to solve rostering conflicts
At the heart of GamOR is an algorithm that creates a full roster. It takes into consideration legal scheduling requirements such as minimum break times and staffing levels while also trying to fulfil a maximum of employee requests and preferences that are pre-loaded into the system.
Employees can request days off
The algorithm identifies situations where staff needs or legal requirements collide. In the GamOR app, users are shown these planning conflicts early on and presented with easy-to-understand alternative solutions. These conflicts can then be discussed and solved in personal interactions between nursing staff.
Detailed view of conflicting demands
This leaves space for individual exchange and for nursing staff to discuss their personal needs. The collaborative nature of the GamOR app gives staff an active voice in their rosters. The often overriding scheduling hierarchy is flattened, as superiors don’t have to be involved in each conflict as long as staff find their own solution independently.
The algorithm suggests solutions for planning conflicts
#### A playful way to improve planning
One project milestone was the design of an understandable, easy-to-operate interface that tames the complexity of the system. The interface purposefully features playful elements that promote and visualize reconciliation.
Gamification: the customizable screensaver shows the planning status of individual employees as well as visualizing their joint goal: solving the scheduling puzzle.
With GamOR, we’re showing that increasing wellbeing isn’t about maximum automation, rather a sensitive adjustment of this automation to suit identified user needs. GamOR successfully strikes a balance between technical support, economic optimization and satisfying human needs. Transparency and fairness in scheduling are the focus, as well as promoting autonomy and staff wellbeing.
#### Project and research partners
The research and development project, funded as part of the ‘future of work’ program by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) and the European Social Fund (ESF), involves six strong partners that each apply their expertise to one area of the project:

Ottobock has made it its mission to close this gap. Even back in 1919, the company’s innovative products and technologies were pursuing the aim of improving the lives of all users. Lost or restricted physical abilities are being restored with the aid of modern technology, using sensors, robotics and artificial intelligence. Today, this encompasses microprocessor-controlled knee joints, computer-controlled orthotics and the impressive Michelangelo prosthetic hand.
The overarching aim is constant technological development in order to improve the lives of users.

One thing’s for sure: humans are becoming increasingly mechanized. We wear smartwatches that monitor our bodily functions and smart glasses that let us glimpse a parallel digital world. The era of the exoskeleton has only just begun. But our environment is also increasingly characterized by smart buildings and cities as well as interactive objects. Even today, there are hardly any everyday objects - from streetlamps to trash cans - without sensors or some kind of tiny computer. This is laying the foundations for the connected smart city of tomorrow.  
The interactive systems of the future are multifaceted and almost impossible to understand without explicit help. Interdisciplinary teams of experts from town planning, product design, IT and experience, such as our colleagues at Ergosign, are working towards humans, technology and the environment becoming one to create spaces of intuitive interaction.
#### HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN AS KEY
The human-centered design of intuitive, self-explanatory systems is more important than ever. This ensures that technology works around humans in the future as well as today - and not the other way around. When used properly, this can be ensured with the help of human-centered design principles and methods. This applies to image-supported user interfaces as well as interaction with objects such as exoskeletons and other smart objects.
> Human-centered design principles and the responsible use of technology ensure humanity’s autonomous use of technical support systems.
At Ergosign, we have been designing products and services that support people in their work and enrich their lives for over 20 years. We make technology manageable and ensure it is used in a way that makes sense. Many technology-driven companies are yet to open up possibilities to humans. At Ottobock, this principle has been deeply anchored since its foundation. This is just one aspect of many that are making this company more valuable than ever before in a technology-focused world.
#### Jan's personal takeaway
> Skepticism of modern technology is completely understandable. When used responsibly, this is mostly unfounded. Modern technology such as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems and exoskeletons have the potential to have a positive impact on our environment. Companies such as Ottobock reinforce my position as a self-avowed technology optimist. The human-centered design of interactive systems - whether that’s on the body, on colorful displays or all around us - has the potential to make our world even more worth living in. The most important key in designing this future: Humans.
In order to be able to optimally advise and support our clients, we analyze future trends extremely precisely. As part of our visit, we were also able to have an inspiring exchange of ideas with exoskeleton experts and UX designers.

16/05/2022 • 5 minutes reading time
It's been two years since our last “Group Focus Time” @Ergosign. So we were very excited to see many familiar and new faces come together on Friday, May 13, when everyone flocked back to the offices in Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Saarbrücken, Munich, Basel, and Zurich so that we could spend a creative day together.
#### What is a “Group Focus Time”?
Our “Focus Time” has been a regular event since 2017. Four hours of the second Friday of every month are reserved for all of our colleagues for dealing with an (innovation) topic of their choice - alone or collaboratively.
Once a year, we then host a big “Group Focus Time” where we spend a whole day collaborating and developing ideas within a specific theme.
This way, we can further support our team's creativity, gain a new perspective on things and support the internal exchange beyond customer projects. 
The theme this year was “Music and Sound”.
What do music and sound have to do with Ergosign and UX? A whole lot!
Our team developed a total of 42 ideas and started to work on them.
Impression of the Group Focus Time 2022
#### Xmosphere from Hamburg
Our team in Hamburg loves to play table football, so developing an app for table football sounds was an obvious choice for them. This app will offer all the usual stadium sounds to create the perfect atmosphere during a game. The idea was initially brainstormed collaboratively via Miro and defined as an absolute MVP before being visualized as a prototype on Miro.
#### Ergo-S-I-N-G from Berlin
On the other hand, our team in Berlin wanted to bring music into the office both acoustically and visually. This way, music, and ambiance can be automatically combined.
The team designed an artwork with an NFT tag on it. If you scan the tag with your smartphone, a playlist plays via the integrated artwork speakers, and LEDs flash in coordination with the sound. The technical communication between sound, light, and smartphone takes place via shortcuts from Apple. This clever solution is like a simple ""if-then query"" or ""if-then"" in programming logic.
That means: ""if"", if NFC tag is scanned, ""then"", then this playlist opens on Apple Music and activates the LEDs. #partyon
#### ‚Synesthisia’ Music perception drawing
A collaboration between Berlin and Saarbrücken was particularly creative and partly abstract. The team adapted the ""Crazy 8 Method"" and used it to create a collaborative piece of art.
Each team member chose a song and, inspired by the music, everyone drew to this song for 10 minutes. Afterwards, pictures and songs were passed on to the next person. This was repeated until everyone had listened to and drawn to every song.
The playlist was just as colorful as the finished pictures:
> • Narcotic - Liquido
> • Astronaut in the Ocean - Masked Wolf
> • Ending Theme - Jorge Granda
> • New Day Rising - Hüsker Dü
> • Ocean Drive - Duke Dumont
> • I Shot the Sheriff - Eric Clapton
This is what drawn music warning looks like
#### On Air - Nobody disturbs you in the video call anymore
It has probably happened to all of us: We were sabotaged by colleagues, partners, children, or cats during a Zoom meeting, or we chatted happily while someone else was in a Zoom meeting…
That's why another Saarbrücken team developed an ""On Air"" light. As soon as a Zoom meeting starts, the lamp lights up red. If there is no active meeting, green indicates free travel for conversations with the environment.
This ingenious solution was realized with a Python script, which queries the Zoom processes from the computer and forwards them to the Arduino IDE for controlling the ""On Air"" display.
The ""On Air"" display may not yet help with interruptions by pets, but it is an innovative step into the future for our human interaction in everyday work. We will continue to work on this and keep you posted… 
#### Munich - Miss my Office
Based on the 'I Miss My Bar' website, the second Munich team created a website with typical Ergosign Munich sounds. It lets you play ambient sounds if you feel lonely in your home office. You can also select individual sounds suitable for certain topics. No stock material was used for the sounds; all sounds were recorded in the office. The illustrations are also based on the Munich office and are available as SVG. The SVG was later implemented as a prototype together with the sounds using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
#### The Sounds of Basel
The team in Basel took us on an auditory journey from the train station to the Basel office. The various stations were recorded with the iPhone's voice memo app. From the train station, we went to the Barfüsser Platz, to the market square, past the Rhine, via the Clara Platz to the coffee machine in the Basel office. Just recording noises would have been too easy. That's why the team created the 'Sounds of Basel' remix with Garage Band.
The Sounds of Basel
#### Memory Fight Game from Stuttgart & Saarbrücken
A cross-collaboration between Stuttgart and Saarbrücken came up with a “memory sound game”. Based on the well-known memory game principle, this game is about remembering which card has which sounds and then identifying pairs of melodies.
A monster is﻿ included for more excitement - because it attacks if sound pairs are not uncovered fast enough.
This idea was implemented with Unity and the programming language C#. The teams have definitely shown how quickly and purposefully an application can be designed and developed with creative design.
Excerpt from the game
These projects and concepts are just a small excerpt of the many exciting and innovative ideas that sprung up during Group Focus Time 2022.
We would like to thank everyone for this exciting day!

> The terms “climate” and “software” are everywhere. At first glance, there is no obvious connection between the two. But the hidden link between these two areas constantly defines our daily lives, so it’s worth getting informed.
In 2014, the IT sector ranked fourth in global energy consumption. According to a “worst case scenario” estimation, the proportion of energy consumed by infrastructure often termed “the internet” (e.g. networks, data centers and cloud services) has increased by a third to around 50% over the last 5 years (see figure: Distribution of Energy Consumption in the IT Sector 2012 vs. 2017). In their annual “ClickGreen Report”, Greenpeace assesses the environmental footprint of the internet as a whole and its largest players (Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.). Just like our flights and car journeys, the internet also impacts our environment.
Quelle: Greenpeace ClickGreen 2017
#### Personal carbon footprint
There are people who like to drive, people that only use a car where necessary and people that generally avoid car travel. I belong to the first group. I like to drive fast even when I’m not in any particular rush. And sometimes I use my car because it’s easier. I’m almost thirty and am employed as a Software Engineer at Ergosign, a digital agency for user experience design. I would call myself a “tech head”. I am probably a little more consumption-oriented than the average German and am happy to spend money on things that I don’t necessarily need – technical trinkets if you like. I used the Umwelt Bundesamt’s CO2 calculator (source: CO2 calculator) to work out my carbon footprint based on my lifestyle. At around 16t of CO2 per year, mine is considerably above average when compared to the average German score of 11t per year. But why am I telling you all of this?
We don’t go around spewing out the greenhouse gas CO2 with everything we do. But everything we do as humans is linked to a certain measurable amount of waste or emissions. This waste could be almost anything. Obvious examples include plastic waste, electronic waste or specific greenhouse gasses such as CO2 created by car or plane travel.
Of course, CO2 isn’t the only greenhouse gas, and electronic and plastic waste are not the only ways we put pressure on our environment. In order to keep things comparable, a CO2 equivalent can be calculated for each type of emission or waste. It’s the amount of CO2 that would cause as much strain on the environment as the specific waste or emissions.
When we apply this to my work in software and product development, it doesn’t just matter how sustainably I work, or how much CO2 I save during my work, but also the environmental footprints of the products I work on. So, above all, the process involved in making a sustainable software or hardware product is vital. The amount of CO2 created on the path to a finished product is added to the complete product’s CO2 footprint. It’s not just about saving costs and resources for the business, but also increasing usability to improve the planet a little.
#### Can “green development” help save the planet?
“Help save the planet” of course sounds a little idealistic, but it contains a key concept that shouldn’t be underestimated. We can actually help the planet when we consider the reach of a design or development decision.
A simplified example: let’s say you’re developing a smartphone app. You’ve managed to get your app well known and have several million users – they all use exactly the same product. The ecological sustainability of your app multiplies as your users multiply. Software products such as apps can be distributed especially rapidly. Just head to the App Store, download and then the “sustainable” or not-so-sustainable app is up and running on another device.
Your app will most probably use the internet. Each transfer of data via the internet is processed by multiple services within the “digital supply chain” without the user explicitly being aware of this. Each of these services uses electricity in the simplest sense, whereby each use results in a quantifiable CO2 equivalent for the energy consumed. So with each internet access, the CO2 footprint of your app grows. So, a more “efficient” use of the internet can improve the CO2 balance of each individual instance of your app. When you consider all use of the app, the amount of energy saved, or its CO2 equivalent can be immense.
Anything that uses the internet has an impact on our environment. Streaming a song on Spotify, sending a WhatsApp message, visiting a website, sending an email, searching for something on Google, or even a simple Tweet. All of this has an environmental impact that can be calculated in terms of a CO2 equivalent. Each Tweet on Twitter is equivalent to 0.02g CO2 (valid as of April 19th, 2010, Jaymi Heimbuch - Treehugger Blog). This means that Donald Trump alone has created almost a kilo of CO2 since his Twitter account was set up. 0.02g might not sound like a lot. But with Twitter’s huge user base sending out 6,000 Tweets per second, a CO2 equivalent of 120g is generated each second. This amounts to 10t of CO2 per day just through Tweets – this almost amounts to the annual CO2 equivalent of the average German.
#### Online and offline
Internet use isn’t the only way to improve the overall carbon footprint of many devices and software programs. There are a variety of ways to improve the efficiency of a product in terms of environmental sustainability without having to change the product itself. Often, products may have little to no impact on energy consumption. My washing machine, for example, has an eco-mode that I almost never use. Not because I actively refuse to save energy, but because I have to use complicated controls to set it up. An unnecessary hurdle for which there is a simple solution. In principle, all programs could save energy by washing more slowly and using less water and power. I could have to make the effort to use a “more energy” option if I wanted my laundry done more quickly. I would have to actively decide to use more energy for a specific purpose.
A sustainable design concept would take the hurdle away which is preventing the user from saving energy, making this option easier.
Everyone can be supported in reducing their energy consumption and improving their carbon footprint without sacrificing comfort and ease of use.
> This method of gently supporting the user in taking responsibility for their carbon footprint is called “green defaults”. The responsibility for a “reasonable” carbon footprint doesn’t just lie with the user and their behavior, but also with the product’s developers and UX designers.
Concepts such as “green UX”, sustainable user experience, and “green development”, sustainable and efficient development as well as the technologies used are becoming more and more important.
Today, new technologies are being developed rapidly, and software has become an integral part of even the most banal objects. In many products, the concern is no longer just practicality, but rather the way in which something happens. Software efficiency and sustainability play a significant role. It’s more important than ever to consider concepts such as sustainability and efficiency at the very beginning of a development process, from a technical as well as a user-oriented perspective. “Every little bit helps”.

> The terms “climate” and “software” are everywhere. At first glance, there is no obvious connection between the two. But the hidden link between these two areas constantly defines our daily lives, so it’s worth getting informed.
In 2014, the IT sector ranked fourth in global energy consumption. According to a “worst case scenario” estimation, the proportion of energy consumed by infrastructure often termed “the internet” (e.g. networks, data centers and cloud services) has increased by a third to around 50% over the last 5 years (see figure: Distribution of Energy Consumption in the IT Sector 2012 vs. 2017). In their annual “ClickGreen Report”, Greenpeace assesses the environmental footprint of the internet as a whole and its largest players (Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.). Just like our flights and car journeys, the internet also impacts our environment.

#### Personal carbon footprint
There are people who like to drive, people that only use a car where necessary and people that generally avoid car travel. I belong to the first group. I like to drive fast even when I’m not in any particular rush. And sometimes I use my car because it’s easier. I’m almost thirty and am employed as a Software Engineer at Ergosign, a digital agency for user experience design. I would call myself a “tech head”. I am probably a little more consumption-oriented than the average German and am happy to spend money on things that I don’t necessarily need – technical trinkets if you like. I used the Umwelt Bundesamt’s CO2 calculator (source: CO2 calculator) to work out my carbon footprint based on my lifestyle. At around 16t of CO2 per year, mine is considerably above average when compared to the average German score of 11t per year. But why am I telling you all of this?
We don’t go around spewing out the greenhouse gas CO2 with everything we do. But everything we do as humans is linked to a certain measurable amount of waste or emissions. This waste could be almost anything. Obvious examples include plastic waste, electronic waste or specific greenhouse gasses such as CO2 created by car or plane travel.
Of course, CO2 isn’t the only greenhouse gas, and electronic and plastic waste are not the only ways we put pressure on our environment. In order to keep things comparable, a CO2 equivalent can be calculated for each type of emission or waste. It’s the amount of CO2 that would cause as much strain on the environment as the specific waste or emissions.
When we apply this to my work in software and product development, it doesn’t just matter how sustainably I work, or how much CO2 I save during my work, but also the environmental footprints of the products I work on. So, above all, the process involved in making a sustainable software or hardware product is vital. The amount of CO2 created on the path to a finished product is added to the complete product’s CO2 footprint. It’s not just about saving costs and resources for the business, but also increasing usability to improve the planet a little.

We all know that interactive data visualization is an effective communication tool for easily conveying even complex contexts: if applied correctly, users can use them to discover hidden patterns, change perspectives and develop new ideas. But how can we create data visualizations which best assist users in their tasks? And how can we test interactive visualizations where they are actually needed?
#### Generating insights and findings from seemingly abstract pain data?
For the treatment of chronic pain, data about the changes of the patient’s condition, movement profiles, sleeping habits, the weather or the timing of therapy measures are observed over a long period of time, analyzed and investigated for patterns and correlations. To do this, pain therapists require an effective and efficient tool. In this context, (interactive) data visualization assists human cognition in the rapid recognition of patterns, gaps and outliers – even for large amounts of data. Therefore, the basis of my work was the search for such an interactive data visualization:
“Quiri Analyzer” was created in the third phase of the overall “Quiri” project and complements this with a user interface for medical staff for the evaluation of the data collected from individual pain patients.
#### How does one visualize data for pain therapy?
In this blog entry I would first like to exclude the technical requirements (what type of data is collected in what cycle for what diagnosis). A special challenge from the UX perspective, was finding a suitable prototyping tool with which the visualization of and interaction with complex amounts could be appropriately evaluated with users, also in the run-up.
I found a few approaches in my research on the topic of prototyping. From intensive paper prototyping to exclusive digital mock-ups: Unfortunately, many of these methods were only suitable for very few interactive visualizations or for very small amounts of data. From the varied repertoire of prototyping methods, I had to choose those which met my requirements:
  * flexible design and adjustment of large amounts of data points
  * ideally, a responsive design
  * interactivity!
  * functional prototype
  * possibility of exploratory testing with users


Another particularity in this project was a small target group which is difficult to access: Pain therapists are usually very busy people with heavy schedules. Consequently, within the evaluation session, as little as possible abstraction, but rather concrete “exploring” by means of realistic patient data was to be evaluated in order to receive valuable feedback for my case, i.e. meaningful data had to flow into a highly functional prototype in order to test my aspired filter concept.
#### The tools of my choice
For the visualization of the individual parameters that are relevant for the pain therapy, I first scribbled notes onto paper. Written notes on paper are a good basis for making rudimentary decisions and discussing first approaches with colleagues. I also presented the rough layout as well as the idea of the filter concept and the temporal representation of the data in this way.
Quick changes or new ideas were no problem!
Our Quiri projectEvaluation
With this approach, in a second prototyping phase, I was able to first test the layout and the UI in digital wireframes in the prototyping tool Antetype. In this phase I mainly worked with static contents and concentrated on the fundamental UI. With the jump to a digital prototype I for example had the option of using recurring elements via “copy-paste” or hiding and showing information. Together with my colleague I performed a few expert reviews by means of this prototype, in order to include improvements in the further iteration.
In this project phase, Antetype made it possible to develop and adjust the options, layout, interactions with the UI and a responsive behavior.
Talking to Dr. Jansen
However, as user experience in the evaluation of such great amounts of data ultimately depends on the possible interactions with the data, and these must feel as real and correct as possible, I had to opt for a functional prototype. As I had already had first experiences with the Framework D3.js, and because I required a high level of flexibility of the visualizations for “Quiri Analyzer”, I decided on the D3 and the implementation as a HiFi prototype with web technologies.
After a short phase of getting familiar with the possibilities of D3, I was able to gradually implement the concept from Antetype and design the interactions realistically. In this phase of prototyping, I made decisions on what behavior feels natural and can optimally support users.
With the developed prototype I asked for qualitative feedback on the use from two users. The approach of letting users “explore” by means of realistic patient data exceeded my expectations and turned out to be exactly right.
> ""It's particularly great to view the graph together with the patient. [...] People love pictures. Yes? Most people are visually triggered, and when one shows it to them and holds up a mirror: 'They have a look for themselves. That’s them. Nobody else'. This provides a great sense of momentum. Cool."" Dr. Bialas
In a second loop, a visual design was added to the prototype and improvements from the validation were integrated. Created in Antetype and implemented in CSS styles, the final version of my prototype was created.
#### Conclusion
By means of the “Quiri Analyzer” practical example I have shown you my (an) approach of prototyping for interactive big data visualizations. The effort of an expansive prototyping phase is worth it, try it for yourselves!

I clearly remember trying out this new DriveNow service early in the last decade: it felt like science fiction suddenly became a reality. The smartphone opened the door to a new dynamic world of mobility – which before had only seen the long, unrelenting battle between cars and public transport   
  
It all started a few years earlier with the sharing economy concept: sharing things and thereby creating new benefits - for users, service providers, and society. An early driver of this trend in the mobility sector were these new forms of car sharing, which made it possible to rent vehicles easily via smartphone.  
  
With these first options, many people, like me, grew to think that mobility just had to be made smarter and that many real, long-standing traffic and mobility problems could be solved. It seemed clear that our experience with mobility would change completely. At the same time, social pressure grew: the usual way of dealing with cars and traffic chaos was simply no longer acceptable due to ever stricter climate protection regulations and after a loss of trust like ""Dieselgate"".  
  
That was the big game changer that would change and revolutionize entire industries, and I was there live. My optimism was limitless, and the prospects for the future seemed clear. But towards the end of the decade, things changed.
#### Sand in the gears
So it became clear that sand ended up in the gear works and that the awaited future world might not become a reality (so soon). Self-driving cars were absent, although traditional manufacturers and new attackers like Tesla and others widely heralded them as ""market-ready"" soon. Although car sharing increased, it remained an overseeable niche in mobility. And when it came to networking the offers, there were indeed many ""mobility apps"" on offer. Still, really integrated solutions for an elegant journey from A to B from a single source remained a dream of the future.Had we been too naïve and hailed a (technology-centric) revolution that might never happen?
Traffic congestions are still a regular occurrence, even in 2023.
#### Reality check
Not quite, because despite the disappointments, there were many lasting changes: Automation developed splendidly in niches (e.g., autonomous delivery robots), and the evolutionary development of driver assistance systems to increasingly autonomous vehicles in defined areas continued.  
  
And at the same time, our mobility is much more networked than it was 10-15 years ago. Information about mobility options and offers is now available more and quicker than ten years ago. Sharing and merging information across platforms is now the rule rather than the exception. More and more products are also working together in ticketing. Real-time information is also becoming more and more a matter of course for mobility offers. Together with the tremendous pull effect of sustainable electrification, impressive innovations emerged at many interfaces.  
  
That motivated us, that motivated me. But is this the significant change we've collectively envisioned over the past decade that should bring a better world (for our children and us)? Is the big vision still achievable, and how do we get there?

#### The new way from A to B
So what really needs to be done to build a more sustainable, better mobility? In my opinion, it is not enough to focus on technologies and innovations or to think about the market maturity of services that may have been launched too early. Because, at its core, it is primarily about people and their most important basic needs. In mobility, I suggest focusing on 3 of these needs:
  * Safety in mobility has many facets, including your own safety, your passenger's safety, and other road users' safety. This also includes protection against discomfort or even an attack in public space, a key argument for using vehicles by minority groups.
  * Comfort describes how the time spent traveling is made as pleasant as possible because it often involves considerable effort, and any stress reduction improves the travel experience considerably. It's less about heated seats or exclusive extras like premium vehicles or (airport) lounges. Instead, it is about how easy it is to transport luggage, whether you can use the travel time for work, leisure, or sleep, or how complex the organization of a trip is.
  * Status is often closely related to comfort needs and corresponds to people's desire to express achieved status in life. However, limiting this need to exclusive offers on trains, flights, and more expensive cars does not hit the nail on the head. Rather, the status symbol car is deeply anchored worldwide as a marker for success in life. For example, the desire to ""own a car"" is often about proving that you've reached a significant milestone in life.


To enable new mobility on a broad basis, I think it is essential to focus on these three basic needs and to specify them for application-related use with the right groups of people. From my own experience, I see families and seniors as particularly critical for a mobility revolution's success because they are often involuntarily forced into an automotive reality without really feeling comfortable in it. And they often have the financial clout to pay for new products and services.  
  
In addition, a discussion about how we can create an attractive, safe environment with more comfort, especially in shared mobility, is inevitable. In this context, we should seek more discussion about mobility as a third place; visionary projects such as the Deutsche Bahn Ideas Train (as shown in the picture, photo credits dpa) point in the right direction.
Train of ideas Deutsche Bahn
Public transport has a long history of making traveling in shared vehicles accessible and increasingly enjoyable. However, these findings must now be transferred to all modes of transport, our cities, and communities. From my point of view, the lack of success in sharing concepts can be explained by the focus on travel optimization and financial incentives instead of security, comfort, and status. However, the entire mobility change will not be successful without effective and flourishing sharing concepts.  
  
We need consistent advances in improving our lives: what should our cities and settlements look like, how do we want to travel, and how do we want to live better?

#### Imagine this… 
You have an idea or a product in an early development stage. Now, you want to know if it fulfills its purpose and gain a better understanding of its future Look & Feel. You also want to test its acceptance with real users.
Yet not developed, your product does not leave the chances to be tested conventionally. But you still need like to know in advance if the design is worth further development.
What would you do?
> ""The technologies that we design do not, and never will, exist in a vacuum."" — Bill Buxton
#### Leaves room for improvement: classic prototyping
Typically, usability professionals start with defining the product goals and user groups, and continue with developing prototypes for testings. Prototypes, as opposed to the final product, need not to be fully functional. Basically, they only need to fulfill two goals: look like a product and let researchers test a selected number of scenarios.
So far, so good.
But imagine you’re prototyping a software or an embedded UI for an industrial machine or a complex environment. In this context, the influence of the interaction and impression of the machine might be crucial to the success of your interface.
Will testing your idea in a neutral environment deliver a realistic experience?  
How could you efficiently test an interface without its respective hardware?
Well… Mixed Reality might be the answer.
When the project started we used the HoloLens 1 — the second generation was not available yet
#### Exploring new possibilities: Prototyping in Mixed Reality
There exist various ways of prototyping, ranging from completely physical to completely virtual scenarios.
Before Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 was released, we explored augmenting the hardware to the testing scenario using the first generation of HoloLens.
The idea was to give the user a more realistic understanding of the size and appearance of a product, i.e., the hardware, plus a real display to interact with.
Imagine the basic workflow as follows:
A designer creates a digital UI prototype in a prototyping tool and exports it to a web format (HTML, CSS, JS).
The resulting export is used as an input for a hologram, which represents a physical device.
During the testing, the user wears a HoloLens. He or she interacts with the interface through the browser on a smartphone (or any other web-enabled device) and gets an instant animation or sound.
The machine surrounding the interface is added as a hologram to the screen via the HoloLens.
Both the hologram and the interface are now seen as one system. The interaction and the interface can be tested more realistically.
Hence, designers and developers can test a ready-to-interact product more quickly.  
  
Of course, we have tested the concept at Ergosign. Here’s how:
Our testing scenario: a new interface for a coffee machine
#### Working in the background: the technology
We set up an IPC Network for the interaction between two devices (the screen and the HoloLens) and a user. It includes three major components:
  1. NodeJS Server
  2. TCP .NET Client


The NodeJS server runs on a computer, and two clients run on the smartphone and the HoloLens.
Kommunikation zwischen den Servern, Clients und der HoloLens
We used WebSockets, a TCP based network protocol for a web browser client, with a Unity/UWP (Universal Windows Platform) client.
Code Snippet
The web client sends a message to the server, while the UWP client constantly requests state updates from the server.
The input that the WebSocket client receives serves as a trigger for the animation of the virtual prototype. If a user starts a machine process, the machine hologram reacts accordingly.
Our 3D models are done in Blender or Autodesk 3ds Max, all interactions and particle systems are implemented in Unity.
We also used HammerJS for recognizing touch interactions from the web client and mapping a virtual model to the UI with the help of Vuforia SDK in Unity.
This project started before the second generation of the HoloLens was published and delivered, so the machine is hologrammed with the first generation of the Microsoft HoloLens. We used these glasses as they are wireless, handsfree, offer a decent resolution and might be considered an industry standard. And because technology can have a big impact, we’re curious about how the HoloLens 2 will change the game!
#### Let’s go: our showcase
We built a prototype of a coffee machine to demonstrate how the whole setup should function:
The hologram of a coffee machine is anchored around the physical display of a smartphone. The smartphone is mounted on a tripod, with the UI opened in its browser. Because the interface is designed for a touch display, the user interaction experience is as close as possible to a real interaction with an embedded display.
The user is welcome to play around with the prototype and offered classic scenarios, such as
  * making a regular cup of coffee (pressing a button and observing coffee pouring into the cup)
  * adding milk to it (pressing the button longer)
  * refilling the coffee container after getting an error message.


This setup also allows testing how the digital UI accounts for possible safety issues. For example, having a user make herself a cup of tea, requires observing that it is poured from another tap.
#### Summary: the numerous benefits
Remote usability testings have high chances to become a new standard, requiring for reusable, mobile, but robust setup for smooth and effortless interaction.
It will provide the main stakeholders, namely designers, researchers, clients and system users, with a common ground.
It will also equip designers with a tool for better understanding the underlying physical product and early testing design ideas and interaction techniques.  
At the same time, this setup allows researchers to test the interface in order to meet users’ needs.
Our project is the first step towards implementing virtual prototypes in a normal environment.
Remote testing could also be interesting for your project? Feel free to contact us!

  * adding milk to it (pressing the button longer)
  * refilling the coffee container after getting an error message.


This setup also allows testing how the digital UI accounts for possible safety issues. For example, having a user make herself a cup of tea, requires observing that it is poured from another tap.
#### Summary: the numerous benefits
Remote usability testings have high chances to become a new standard, requiring for reusable, mobile, but robust setup for smooth and effortless interaction.
It will provide the main stakeholders, namely designers, researchers, clients and system users, with a common ground.
It will also equip designers with a tool for better understanding the underlying physical product and early testing design ideas and interaction techniques.  
At the same time, this setup allows researchers to test the interface in order to meet users’ needs.
Our project is the first step towards implementing virtual prototypes in a normal environment.
Remote testing could also be interesting for your project? Feel free to contact us!

#### A journey between industry and scientific research
Lead Communication Manager Esther Barra recently spoke with Dr.-Ing. Lukas Flohr (Senior UX Designer & Specialist Mobility) about research projects at Ergosign and earning a doctoral degree while working in an industrial setting. What all of this has to do with autonomous vehicles, context-based prototyping, and Lukas' career path, you can read up below: 
Esther: Lukas, how did you actually come to Ergosign?
Lukas
Esther: When did you discover your interest in the Mobility sector?
Lukas
Esther: What's so fascinating about cars?
Lukas
Esther: Which research projects at Ergosign have you been involved in so far?
Lukas[APEROL](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/aperol/), we focused on the holistic and human-centered design of Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, their development, and evaluation. The idea behind the project was to develop a concept for a fleet of autonomously driving, shared vehicles as part of public transportation for a city like Aachen. We specifically dealt with the development of user interfaces for the required mobility service. The research project was completed in April 2021. Subsequently, we developed related topics at Ergosign and conducted a [follow-up study](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/prototyping-autonomes-fahren/) with a ""Wizard-of-Oz"" setup.
The experiences from [APEROL](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/aperol/) and our own research in this field allowed us to become consortium partners in the [STADT:up research project](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/stadt-up) (Solutions and Technologies for Automated Driving in Town: an Urban Mobility Project). With a total of 22 partners, this project, funded by the BMWK, on automated driving in urban areas is even larger than APEROL. At Ergosign, we are primarily concerned with interaction concepts to explain automation behavior in complex inner-city traffic situations.
Esther: How did you choose the topic for your dissertation?
Lukas[APEROL](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/aperol/). However, when it became clear that the originally planned testing of the developed concepts with real automated vehicles could not take place as planned, we focused more on prototyping methods. In line with our human-centered approach, we wanted to evaluate the user interfaces we developed early on — such as in usability tests — to ensure that our concepts actually meet the requirements of users and stakeholders. A central challenge was to consider the dynamic context of driverless driving during testing appropriately. We assumed that both the physical and social context of a (shared) driverless journey would have a significant impact on the evaluation of our designs. Therefore, we intensively dealt with context-based prototyping and cost-effectively set up our own set-ups that allowed meaningful studies. This included, for example, the video-based driving simulator or our [Wizard-of-Oz](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/prototyping-autonomes-fahren/) vehicle. This ultimately led to the choice of the topic for my 
Esther: What was your daily work like during the dissertation, and how did Ergosign support you?
Lukas
As for support: I had several great mentors at Ergosign who gave me a high degree of responsibility, freedom, and trust, such as my team leaders Stefan Schulz and Stefan Kiefer. Especially Sebastian C. Scholz and Professor Dr. Dieter Wallach supported me greatly during the active phase of the dissertation. Dieter had the administrative leadership in [APEROL](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/aperol/), while I took on the technical leadership. Dieter also supported me in finding a supervisor and introduced me to my doctoral advisor Professor Dr. Antonio Krüger from DFKI. Towards the end of the dissertation period, Ergosign granted me a month of special leave to fully concentrate on writing my dissertation. In addition, I was able to present our research results at exciting conferences and conferences, such as the ACM Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) Conference in Pittsburgh in the summer of 2023.
Esther: A doctorate in a company like Ergosign is rather unusual; why do you think it's a good fit?

Readi is a strategic research project that focuses on researching methods to strengthen the resilience of companies — insights from this flow into our [Organizational Design](https://ergosign.de/en/services/organizational-design/) service and enrich the methods arsenal used in customer projects.

"https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/qm-at-ergosign","Quality Management at Ergosign","# Quality Management at Ergosign
Katharina Roos
01/01/2019 • 5 minutes reading time
The “Creative chaos” is literal. And it’s actually not uncommon for design service providers to initially wince when confronted with the prospect of introducing a quality management system (QMS). “Quality management” may initially sound like bureaucracy or at least the limitation of freedom. But are these preconceptions justified? Or could they even be counterproductive?
Ergosign has been certified in compliance with DIN EN ISO9001 since 2014. With recertification in June of this year and adaptation to the latest version of the norm (ISO 9001:2015), it seems like a good time to tackle this topic by means of a retrospective.
Ergosign uses the processes defined within the QMS framework in order to be able to guarantee and constantly improve self-defined quality targets. Our concept of quality also includes the ability to innovate and the creativity of developed solutions. In addition to this primary goal, continuous change, the involvement of all staff and a critical examination of existing processes all promote constant improvement at a meta level. The resulting process of constant improvement becomes a thought process deeply rooted in all areas of the company. All processes are explicitly defined and clearly explained in Ergosign’s internal online handbook. Work processes, objectives, results and the right contacts are transparently documented and accessible to all members of staff at all times. It is very evident that new employees in particular are set to benefit from the introduction of this QM system.
Retrospective kanban board
> Along with the necessary freedom, QMS really helped me get my bearings and settle in. On one hand, I was able to recognize the actions that are important for me and make a productive start, and on the other, I found out everything about the work processes that are important for me and who I could turn to if I had questions or needed support.
Noemi Gsponer
Like any structural change in a company, the introduction of a QMS causes uncertainty to begin with. At first, the initiation of a QM system comes with a (perceived) increase in workload - regarding documentation, for instance. In order to promote acceptance early on, we implemented a “lean philosophy” from the very beginning and used a systematic selection of suitable methods, such as lightweight, digital Kanban boards for project documentation, that quickly convinced staff that this exercise would even result in increased efficiency and more room for creativity. The introduction of equally lightweight quality gateways and retrospectives were our major highlights. They not only resulted in the direct improvement of solutions and processes, but also helped to make palpable the immediate value added to the company - and each member of staff - by a QMS.
Allowing each member of staff a certain level of freedom, not forcing them to subject themselves unyieldingly even to existing processes but rather allowing them to react with a sense of appropriateness and a healthy dose of common sense, resulted in a high level of acceptance among all employees. This was also the case for the approach of not insisting that staff adjust themselves to suit processes proven only in theory or in textbooks, rather designing processes so that they optimally support staff in their work. Just like in our customer project, analyses were carried out in advance and processes developed and validated together with the affected employees.
ISO 9001 therefore directly supports our human-centered approach by embedding this philosophy into a comprehensive company model.
> To sum it up: no processes for processes’ sake, rather processes as tools for efficient work and as support for work and creativity while maintaining the same high level of quality.
Marcus Plach
At Ergosign, QM also means the promotion of transparency and confidence among all employees. This results in less uncertainty, both internally and in customer communication, thanks to clear and unified approaches but also a comprehensive understanding of our products and processes.
Our QMS offers another source of inspiration regarding customer-facing work. The internal “quality gateways” already mentioned, which take place at clearly defined times within a project, offer the valuable opportunity to develop and safeguard ideas and arguments. This gives our customers an internally optimized result, and the newly added requirements from the ISO standard regarding knowledge management are more than fulfilled.
Another important component of our QMS is the operationalization of structured customer feedback. Our customers have the chance to give feedback in a standardized format that evaluates our ongoing improvement process and that is passed onto the members of staff involved. Experience has shown that measuring customer satisfaction is the most suitable way to improve the customer experience and create an even closer and longer-term bond with our customers.
#### To sum it up
Defined processes and a deeper anchoring of the idea of a constant process of improvement do not oppose creative processes. Quite the opposite: a QMS allows companies in strong growth phases to concentrate on the creative and value-adding content of their work processes. Of course, the introduction of a QMS may also lead to some steamrollering, but this can be corrected. The moderate additional workload in documentation is more than counteracted by the avoidance of inefficiency, the reduction of knowledge loss and lack of clarity in standard problems, and an improvement of transparency. An important success factor regarding the introduction of a QMS is taking into account the company’s existing culture, closely involving staff from the beginning, and maintaining permanent discussion even after the introduction. Design and quality are not matters of taste - the combination of UX services and quality management is simply a matter of logic.

After our first look under the hood of [_Qt in our Insights article in 2021_](https://www.ergosign.de/en/insights/2021/qt6_under_the_hood.html#noCookies|1674567279880) we now have an update for you.
Qt6 brought new module features but also some limitations. For example, Qt6 no longer provides preconfigured shader effects as known from Qt5, but only a shader effect API. Our Qt Specialist Lukas couldn't accept that.
#### Open Source – Qt Shader Effects Module
Therefore, we are thrilled to present the Qt shader effects module to the open-source community. While the QmlPlugin was created out of necessity, we were keen to share it with the community.
With Qt6, the whole shader system changed, so now it is possible to write shaders not only for OpenGL, but also for Vulkan, DirectX, Metal, etc. So far, so good, but using the Qt5 shader effect is no longer possible. Qt itself has extracted a 
In our Qt shader effects module
#### Download and enhance
The shader effects module can be used freely and extended without claiming correctness and at your own risk. Check out the sample application there to see how the different shaders work. The project structure was created with cmake.
We would love to see the module improved and extended with more shader effects by the open-source community in this GitHub project. So join us and make it happen!
Thanks to Lukas for sharing your Qt shader effects module

After our first look under the hood of [_Qt in our Insights article in 2021_](https://www.ergosign.de/en/insights/2021/qt6_under_the_hood.html#noCookies|1674567279880) we now have an update for you.
Qt6 brought new module features but also some limitations. For example, Qt6 no longer provides preconfigured shader effects as known from Qt5, but only a shader effect API. Our Qt Specialist Lukas couldn't accept that.
#### Open Source – Qt Shader Effects Module
Therefore, we are thrilled to present the Qt shader effects module to the open-source community. While the QmlPlugin was created out of necessity, we were keen to share it with the community.
With Qt6, the whole shader system changed, so now it is possible to write shaders not only for OpenGL, but also for Vulkan, DirectX, Metal, etc. So far, so good, but using the Qt5 shader effect is no longer possible. Qt itself has extracted a 
In our Qt shader effects module
#### Download and enhance
The shader effects module can be used freely and extended without claiming correctness and at your own risk. Check out the sample application there to see how the different shaders work. The project structure was created with cmake.
We would love to see the module improved and extended with more shader effects by the open-source community in this GitHub project. So join us and make it happen!
Thanks to Lukas for sharing your Qt shader effects module

## Where does the Wizard of Oz fit into the world of mobility? 
Picture yourself in a car, cruising down the road without a care in the world and without anyone actively driving the car. A long-talked-about scenario finally looks to become a reality, with a lot of research and testing going into the topic to ensure autonomous cars drive safely and passengers feel at ease. 
In a world where artificial intelligence calls the shots on the road, how do you trust a machine to navigate the bustling streets and ensure your safety? That is the focus of a recent study „Prototyping Autonomous Vehicle Windshields with AR and Real-Time Object Detection Visualization: An On-Road Wizard-of-Oz Study“ by Dr. Lukas Flohr, Professor Dr. Dieter Wallach, Joseph S. Valiyaveettil, and Professor Antonio Krüger. They explored how transparent information and passenger-focused interfaces can help to understand and embrace the AI-powered revolution on our roads.
#### The Challenge
While reaching technological maturity, autonomous vehicles (AVs) encounter substantial challenges related to gaining public acceptance. Trust is a primary barrier to AV adoption, hinging on factors such as performance expectations and vehicle reliability. Privacy and security concerns, software errors, and potential hacker attacks further contribute to trust-related barriers. Additional potential user concerns encompass safety, usability, accessibility, and comfort. 
Addressing these challenges is crucial for fostering the adoption of AV technology. A comprehensive understanding of users, systems, and their environment is vital in shaping human-computer interaction strategies to counteract these challenges.
#### A Solution
HMIs are the primary interaction point between passengers and level 4 and 5 AVs. They play a critical role in overcoming acceptance challenges and in building trust. Transparent internal communication has been identified as a key factor for high acceptance and positive user experience (UX). Studies on HMIs, including augmented reality (AR) based concepts, demonstrate their potential to increase trust and situation awareness in automated vehicles. However, findings emphasize the importance of careful design and consideration of the amount of information provided, as excessive details may not necessarily lead to increased trust. These insights underscore the nuanced relationship between information transparency and user trust. This project set out to answer three research questions by prototyping and testing through a Wizard-of-Oz approach: 
  1. Can we increase AV passengers’ acceptance and UX by providing transparent system information via (AR-based) visualization of detected objects in the vehicle windshield? 
  2. How and when should this information be displayed during AV rides in urban environments? 
  3. How can we create a suitable prototyping framework to investigate research question 1 and research question 2, as well as related questions in complex urban real-life environments?

Lukas Flohr, Joseph Valiyaveettil and the testing vehicle.
#### Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
The deployment and, hence, testing of driverless rides in complex urban environments faces significant limitations. Overcoming those is essential for empirical concept studies related to AVs. Context-based prototyping emerges as a viable approach to consider both the complex context and the user experience. Simulators may offer controllability and reproducibility, but they struggle to represent high-fidelity complex environments and are confined to artificial lab contexts. 
In contrast, WoOz set-ups can be applied in real-world environments on public roads, enabling the evaluation of AVs and their human-machine interfaces. The method involves hidden human drivers (wizards) simulating automation. Whilst effective in practice, WoOz presents challenges related to maintaining the illusion and ensuring consistent driving styles, so they require a carefully crafted cover story. Our ruse? We pretended our AV had a state-of-the-art windshield — and we were testing this windshield with AR-based real-time object detection visualization, that still required someone in the driver’s seat for emergencies. 
#### Prototyping to test the solution
Our WoOz setup simulated an AV ride through the city using an electric Mercedes-Benz EQV minivan, providing a flexible and easily replicable set-up for future experiments. The windshield HMI prototype displayed real-time augmented reality (AR) bounding box visualizations over detected objects. Three concept variants were designed, including baseline information, counts of detected objects per class in a status bar, and a combination of both. These variants aimed to gauge the impact of the amount of displayed information on passengers' experience.
Our study involved 30 participants, with a balanced distribution of gender and a diverse age range. Participants experienced test rides in the WoOz vehicle through an urban environment, with stops at parking lots to change HMI variants. Data collection included both quantitative and qualitative measures, such as standardized questionnaires, as well as single-item assessments of perceived risk, safety, well-being, and nausea.
The research methodology also incorporated a semi-structured interview and debriefing session to gather participants' feedback on their preferences. This comprehensive approach aimed to provide valuable insights into enhancing AV passengers' acceptance and UX by leveraging transparent system information, with a focus on the challenges posed by real urban environments. The study's findings can contribute to the development of effective and user-friendly HMIs for future autonomous vehicles.

#### Results and key take-aways: 
  1. The study revealed that providing visual system feedback on detected objects significantly enhances the acceptance and UX of AVs. Participants expressed a strong preference for augmented reality (AR) overlays on the AV windshield, considering them instrumental in improving contextual understanding and trust in the system. However, some participants found them to be too distracting, favoring only general information on the overall system state. 
  2. Participants in the study advocated for configurable display settings in AVs, allowing them to control the presentation of certain information. In terms of content, most participants favored visualizing only objects impacting their ride, with a classification based on hazard level, as opposed to having constant visual feedback on all detected objects. 
  3. You need a thoughtful cover story and suitable hardware appearance for maintaining the WoOz deception, with participants' attention shifted toward the futuristic HMI prototype. 73% of the participants believed that the car was driving autonomously, which indicates a successful application of the WoOZ paradigm.


#### Limitations and potential for future work:
Like most studies, this study experienced some limitations and there are three areas for future research: 
  1. The study sample: the affinity for technology in participants was quite high. This may impact external validity and the belief in the WoOz deception. 
  2. The HMI prototype: a more holistic HMI with a less narrow focus on object detection will allow a broader examination of the topic. Likewise, a more powerful system will decrease performance limitations. 
  3. The WoOz approach: while advantageous for dynamic urban context exploration, the method presents challenges in terms of objectivity and reliability. Overall, the framework created for the study is valuable for prototyping and may be extended to investigate various aspects of autonomous vehicle experiences and HMI concepts.


The future of mobility, AVs, and how UX research and design can contribute to the field is an important passion of ours.

### Potentials and Challenges — a summary by Ergosign
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly revolutionizing the digital world. Recently, the Chinese LLM DeepSeek-R1 (and -V3) has made headlines. With unexpectedly high efficiency and performance, it has not only stormed the app charts but also stirred up tech giants and investors. In this two-part Insights article, we will first look at LLMs in general and then delve deeper into DeepSeek.LLMs form the basis for numerous AI applications that come onto the market almost daily. These models are trained over months on huge amounts of text data using machine learning. After this training, they can understand, complete, translate, and even write texts creatively. Well-known examples are ChatGPT, LLaMA, and Claude.But what actually makes such a model, and what should influence the decisions for using certain LLMs in the company? Why are open-source LLMs like DeepSeek so interesting for companies?
#### Adapting LLMs for Specific Applications
To use an LLM for a company or a specific use case, it often needs additional information about the company, a specific domain, or the respective task. Depending on the context and use case, different methods or strategies come into question:
#### 1. In-Context-Learning
If only a small amount of information is needed, it can be given directly in the prompt during input. In so-called in-context learning, the model learns the task directly from the context. For example:“Read the following article and determine the appropriate newspaper section (e.g., politics, economy, panorama, sports, etc.):Berlin, March 2023 – In the middle of the Pacific, a freighter discovered a drifting wreck yesterday. Two survivors clung to the remains, seriously injured but alive. The cause of the accident remains unclear…”The model uses the provided input to recognize a pattern and make a new decision that it has not been trained on before. This method is suitable, for example, for text or style adaptations for personalized emails or product descriptions.
In-Context-Learning
#### 2. Fine-Tuning
If a language model needs in-depth knowledge about a company, software, or a field of expertise, there is often not enough space for the required context in the input field. One solution is fine-tuning. Here, an already trained model is further trained with specific data. The language model already knows grammar and general language structures but is enriched with context-specific content. Although significantly less data is required for fine-tuning than for the original training, it still needs an appropriate amount of high-quality data in a standardized format. Incorrect information, poorly documented databases, or inferior image and table quality can negatively affect the model. A disadvantage of fine-tuning is that already integrated data can no longer be removed or easily updated. Fine-tuning is useful, for example, for brand-specific text creation: Companies train a model on their own marketing and communication guidelines to generate consistent content in the company's own style.
Fine-Tuning Process
#### 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
A particularly effective method for providing relevant and, above all, factually correct information is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Here, relevant data sources such as documentation, workshop recordings, explanatory videos, or instructions are stored in a vector database and divided into smaller sections (chunks). When a user makes a request, the system searches the database for the most suitable chunks. These are provided to the language model as context in the prompt to generate well-founded answers.
Advantages of RAG:

RAG Process
### The Right Language Model
To decide which language model is suitable for use in the company, there are several factors to consider.
Model SizeThe model size describes the compromise between efficiency, resource use, and quality.Depending on which end device the model is to run on and how good the quality of the output should be, different models come into question. Smaller models are more efficient and less resource-intensive but may be limited in the quality of the generation. Larger models deliver better results but require more computing power and are more costly.
  * Small models: GPT-2, Gemma-2B, Phi-2
  * Medium-sized models: GPT-3.5, Llama-2-13B, Mistral-7B
  * Large models: GPT-4, Llama-2-70B, Claude-Opus, Gemini-Ultra


Infrastructure & Data Protection
The choice of infrastructure is a fundamental decision that depends largely on the type of application and the data protection requirements. The more sensitive the data, the more important the control over its processing. Language models can either be used via a cloud API or hosted on their own servers.
API-based models: These powerful models are very easy to integrate but cause ongoing costs per request. Since the data is sent to external servers, there is less control over the data processing. Examples: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cohere
Self-hosted models: Open-source models can be operated locally or on their own cloud servers. This enables complete data control but requires powerful hardware. This is particularly relevant for data protection regulations such as GDPR or TISAX. Examples: Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, Falcon
### Performance & Domain-Specific Requirements
Depending on the use case, specific models make sense. Some are optimized for technical, legal, or scientific applications, while others can handle multilingual or medical content particularly well. It is worthwhile to compare models and adapt them if necessary. Technical factors such as:
  * Inference Speed:
  * Context Window:


Closed vs. Open Source
Open-source LLMs offer more transparency, adaptability, and control over the data, but require a powerful infrastructure and technical know-how. They are particularly suitable for companies that want to save costs in the long term and customize their models individually. (For the sake of simplicity, we include here open-weights models, where only the trained weights have been published, but not the source code or the training data.)
Closed-source LLMs, on the other hand, are often more powerful and easier to integrate, but involve dependencies on external providers and potential data protection risks. They are ideal for quick implementation and lower maintenance. Since the models are not directly accessible, no one can operate, change, or further develop them independently. They are usually only accessible via API. The choice of the right language model therefore depends on the individual requirements, the budget, and the data protection guidelines. A balanced approach between quality, cost, and security is crucial.

### Potentials and Challenges — a summary by Ergosign
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly revolutionizing the digital world. Recently, the Chinese LLM DeepSeek-R1 (and -V3) has made headlines. With unexpectedly high efficiency and performance, it has not only stormed the app charts but also stirred up tech giants and investors. In this two-part Insights article, we will first look at LLMs in general and then delve deeper into DeepSeek.LLMs form the basis for numerous AI applications that come onto the market almost daily. These models are trained over months on huge amounts of text data using machine learning. After this training, they can understand, complete, translate, and even write texts creatively. Well-known examples are ChatGPT, LLaMA, and Claude.But what actually makes such a model, and what should influence the decisions for using certain LLMs in the company? Why are open-source LLMs like DeepSeek so interesting for companies?
#### Adapting LLMs for Specific Applications
To use an LLM for a company or a specific use case, it often needs additional information about the company, a specific domain, or the respective task. Depending on the context and use case, different methods or strategies come into question:
#### 1. In-Context-Learning
If only a small amount of information is needed, it can be given directly in the prompt during input. In so-called in-context learning, the model learns the task directly from the context. For example:“Read the following article and determine the appropriate newspaper section (e.g., politics, economy, panorama, sports, etc.):Berlin, March 2023 – In the middle of the Pacific, a freighter discovered a drifting wreck yesterday. Two survivors clung to the remains, seriously injured but alive. The cause of the accident remains unclear…”The model uses the provided input to recognize a pattern and make a new decision that it has not been trained on before. This method is suitable, for example, for text or style adaptations for personalized emails or product descriptions.
In-Context-Learning
#### 2. Fine-Tuning
If a language model needs in-depth knowledge about a company, software, or a field of expertise, there is often not enough space for the required context in the input field. One solution is fine-tuning. Here, an already trained model is further trained with specific data. The language model already knows grammar and general language structures but is enriched with context-specific content. Although significantly less data is required for fine-tuning than for the original training, it still needs an appropriate amount of high-quality data in a standardized format. Incorrect information, poorly documented databases, or inferior image and table quality can negatively affect the model. A disadvantage of fine-tuning is that already integrated data can no longer be removed or easily updated. Fine-tuning is useful, for example, for brand-specific text creation: Companies train a model on their own marketing and communication guidelines to generate consistent content in the company's own style.
Fine-Tuning Process
#### 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
A particularly effective method for providing relevant and, above all, factually correct information is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Here, relevant data sources such as documentation, workshop recordings, explanatory videos, or instructions are stored in a vector database and divided into smaller sections (chunks). When a user makes a request, the system searches the database for the most suitable chunks. These are provided to the language model as context in the prompt to generate well-founded answers.
Advantages of RAG:
  * Flexibility: Databases can be expanded and updated as required
  * Precision: The answers are based on specific information
  * Efficiency: No complex fine-tuning of the model necessary


Challenges:
  * Extraction: Finding the right information chunks
  * Relevance: Selecting suitable documents for the request
  * Semantic Matching: Correctly capturing the contextual meaning

#### We are being awarded the “Orte der Arbeit” Saarland architecture prize
Awarded by the Saarland Ministry of Economics every two years, this architectural prize focuses on the theme of “places of work” in 2021. The award highlights the role of design skills as a critical factor for economic success. It underlines the importance of a holistic understanding of design to develop forward-looking strategies and sustainable construction.
A holistic perspective, to be pioneering and economical without sacrificing aesthetic qualities — these are not only the selection criteria for the architecture award but also the cornerstones of our daily work at Ergosign. Our company headquarters reflects this aspiration for our actions in our workplace too.
At almost 2,000 square meters, built to the latest KfW efficiency building standard (KfW 55), Ergosign’s new headquarters was unveiled at Europaallee 20a in Saarbrücken in 2018 — not far from Ergosign’s first company headquarters from 2008 — with a ceremony followed by a party. On 18 November 2021, we proudly and gladly accepted the architecture award together with our architect, Mario Krämer, from architecture firm FloSundK.
We want to use the award as an opportunity to offer some insight into the design and realization of our company headquarters.
Creating a “place of work” for a team that collaborates with customers and partners both flexibly and collaboratively was one of the challenges. At the same time, the building was also to become a place for shared experiences and events.
How does an architect approach a task like this?
„As an architect, I want to precisely understand the task at hand before I begin a draft. This involves getting to know the people that the building is for and internalizing the intention of the design. It’s important to me to collect as much insight about the eventual users’ everyday work, their experiences in the world of work up to this point and, most of all, suggestions as to what could be improved. A major benefit of this project was that we already knew the team and Ergosign’s working methods well, due to designing the first building.
We see communication within the team, as well as externally, as the most defining characteristic of Ergosign. A team that works together and that is in constant discussion – with one another, clients, and other businesses. The main design approach for the new headquarters included a large central room where the whole Ergosign family could come together.""
> „Architecture is good when it is perceived without having studied architecture.“
""Another thing was clear too. The new Ergosign II building must make a bold statement in its external appearance. The almost black metal façade, with portholes on the sides, is reminiscent of a ship. The Ergosign steamer can only be accessed via a narrow jetty (in this case, the consciously small entrance).
To me, architecture is good when you perceive it without having studied architecture. A building is welcome to polarize, too. I think this aim has been achieved successfully with the Ergosign II building,” says Mario Krämer, FloSundK.

Ergosign was founded in 2000 as a pioneer of UX Design in Germany. Today, we are one of the largest digital agencies focusing on User Experience, and a market leader on the DACH market. The decision to choose a location in the Eurobahnhof district was made back in 2007.
A brief look back: what were things in the new “Quartier Eurobahnhof” district like in 2007? And why did we opt for this location twice?
“We were pioneers in the district too!” said founder and CEO Professor Dieter Wallach, laughing. “In 2007, we broke ground at the Eurobahnhof district — thereby driving the development of what is now a flourishing neighborhood. FloSundK already designed our first company building, which was awarded the developer’s prize by the Chamber of Architects in 2010. Our constant growth meant we needed more space for new team members shortly after moving in. Just one year after the move, additional rented space opposite in the QBUS building was not intended as a permanent solution.
By 2017, it was clear that we would build a new, larger company building — Ergosign II. Luckily, we didn’t have to search for long. We quickly found our new building plot, also on Europaallee, just a few numbers down.
The location is unbeatable: very central and close to the city with plenty of options for our lunch breaks, great infrastructure and perfect connections to public transport. We even developed a solution for the rather tight parking situation with our app xPark xPark which makes it possible for everyone to drive to the office spontaneously and find a parking spot easily.“
Ergosign was able to fall back on its own construction experience. There must be lots of learnings that were applied to the construction of the new, second company building?
""Absolutely! There’s a lot that we have learned and done better this time,” says Dieter. “Including that some ideas might sound impressive in a meeting and even on paper, but they’re just not practical in everyday life. We discuss, call and Zoom a lot. We especially wanted a solution that would save us the effort of looking for a free meeting room. The first building had a “telephone cubicle”. A square of sturdy red fabric secured to the ceiling with steel cables floated in the open-plan office. It contained a small workplace that offered sound insulation and privacy to make telephone calls. And it was a real visual highlight. Although it was sadly impractical in practice, so never used. We have learned from it. The new building has a “room within a room” as a telephone box in the large offices. Complete with windows, sound insulation and air conditioning, it can play host to ad hoc meetings — even when these conversations are not intended for everyone’s ears.“
Designing the perfect company building can be compared to our approach in UX projects surprisingly well. We typically begin our client projects with a research phase. Before a concept can be established, we accompany, observe and interview the eventual users to understand their needs and conclude requirements for the design concept from these. Designing our building without involving the users was unthinkable for us.
> „Design balances user requirements, technology and economy.“
„Design balances user requirements, technology and economy” is one of Dieter’s guiding principles. Requirements can often contradict one another — a collaborative approach helps us find the optimal balance.
A team plans together. That sounds exciting and a little complicated. What does “collaboration” mean when constructing a new company building?
Markus Schwetje explains, “it was exciting and very productive. We first founded internal task forces, with all departments and experience levels represented. Interim results were introduced and feedback collected. With the help of regular meetings and digital boards, the group developed ideas and specific suggestions that were then discussed with the architects.
Of course, the roughly 100 other team members at the Saarbrücken site were also constantly informed about the plans and, later, construction progress. We were actively involved in each phase of construction.”
> „We don’t want open-plan offices“
What was the most significant change wanted by the team? And would we do it again?
„There was a clear message: we don’t want open-plan offices,” says Christian Grieger, Head of Site at Saarbrücken. “Design and Development sit next to each other. Splitting up the space into offices with two to five people — depending on size — allows quiet yet still collaborative work and encourages the exchange of expertise. Even the introduction of temporary project offices proved popular.
We’d make the decision to move away from large open-plan offices again, any time!
Another requirement we realized was the design of dedicated creative rooms. Spaces to give the mind room for innovative ideas, far removed from utilitarian meeting room setups. Each room was designed to a particular theme by the employees themselves — from a markedly comfortable, cozy room with carpet and a velvet couch to an industrial look and even a room completely without technology and screens.“
Creative room Ali Farka Toure and one of the many sitting bunks
From the outside, the building is a real eye-catcher with its iconic look and feel. The dark metal facade, round portholes on the sides and the large window front facing the train station.
How did this unusual facade come about?
“The large window front is actually one of the key elements of Ergosign II’s design concept. It reflects the importance of the building’s communicative center that lies behind it. To an extent, the window front opens and illuminates the space where encounters as well as both formal and informal exchanges take place within the framework of Ergosign’s human-centered work culture in the most obvious way,” says Dr. Marcus Plach, co-founder and CEO along with Dieter.
“The dark metal facade and its irregularly arranged slats give the surface a softer or harder texture depending on the sunlight, creating a dynamic contrast to the dark, elegant overall impression. The association of the portholes, i.e. with an object that is constantly moving, is absolutely intended.“
Ergosign II is not just impressive from the outside. There’s plenty going on indoors too. Let’s take a look at the interior: what does the building look like inside? What makes it so special?
„In contrast to the exterior, I’d describe the interior as bright and friendly. When you enter the building, an open staircase leads upstairs while the light-flooded forum provides a warm welcome,” explains Marie-Claire Harnasch enthusiastically.
View of the stairwell and our large kitchen
„The large room with open kitchen and stage is the heart and communicative center of the building. Plenty of seating invites you to chat with colleagues over a coffee or tea.”
Each Friday, the forum is transformed into an event location. Everyone meets for a communal lunch and there is a Lunch & Learn talk on the stage, sometimes held by team members and sometimes by external speakers.
Stage in use, whether at the Group Focus Time or weekly Lunch & Learn
„I think it’s great that these kinds of company rituals have impacted the building’s architecture and that space has been created for them,” continues Marie. “The company building’s clear structure is emphasized. In my view, the symmetrical design and clear divisions have resulted in workplaces of equal quality for all employees. Unlike other office buildings, we don’t have long, empty corridors leading to closed rooms. Instead, each floor has a different purpose at its core while additional offices are separated. I like to stretch my legs around the building and constantly bump into a colleague that might be sitting in one of the seating booths located in all of the building’s heavy traffic areas.
> „My personal highlight: our roof terrace!“
My personal highlight: our roof terrace! Lots of space, fresh air and a great view of Saarbrücken. Especially in spring and summer, it’s a great place to take a lunch break or have a beer after work together.“
> „External calm and internal variety form the framework for this impressive place of work, on the successful implementation of which one can only congratulate the team of developer and architect. - Jury for the “Orte der Arbeit” Saarland architecture award 2021“
Events and communal experiences define Ergosign’s company culture. That’s why it was important to have sufficient space for events in the building. They say all the best parties take place in the kitchen. Can our new building keep up with that?
„Communication, discussion and team spirit are essential to Ergosign’s culture. And which is known to be the best place to chat and celebrate? That’s right, the kitchen. Even at our roofing ceremony, a band played in our kitchen, although there wasn’t actually a kitchen in there at the time. Our new office building offers great options inside and out, from opening ceremonies to Christmas parties, conferences, Group Focus Time, and events with external guests. Everyone knows how important personal interaction is, especially since Coronavirus,” says Christine Gottlieb, who is responsible for corporate communication and events.
Our housewarming party 2018
Good communication needs good acoustics, whether in a meeting, at a talk, or listening to live music. Acoustics played a vital role in our interior design, which was a particular challenge in the forum. Extensive 3D models were used to calculate reverberation time and absorption to ensure that speech can always be heard clearly, everywhere in the long, tall room. The results flowed into the conception of the acoustically effective wooden cladding as well as stage and sound technology. The wood also creates a harmonious balance between steel, glass and concrete.
Fun fact #instafam: the building is regularly used as a focal point for private Instagram photo shoots. What was your favorite moment?
„Groups of mostly young women in front of the windows can distract some people from their work,” says Anna Polzin of her spot directly in the window on the ground floor. “From checking their makeup in the glass to that ever-popular duck face to sneaker product shoots — it never gets boring! The blinds are a welcome shield to stop you from becoming an unwilling internet star.“
#### Our resume
Technological change is not an autonomous process — people design it.
A place of work should support people and add to their daily lives, just like digitization. Successful, sustainable change requires a pioneering spirit, a holistic perspective, collaboration and good partners.
Being awarded the architecture prize underlines our values, to which we will continue to remain true in the future.
We would like to thank Mario, Jens, the whole FloSundK architektur + urbanistik GmbH architecture firm, the GUI, the OBG, the Ergosign team and, of course, all those countless hard-working hands that made our plans reality.
We’re already looking forward to the construction of the next building.

A holistic perspective, to be pioneering and economical without sacrificing aesthetic qualities — these are not only the selection criteria for the architecture award but also the cornerstones of our daily work at Ergosign. Our company headquarters reflects this aspiration for our actions in our workplace too.
At almost 2,000 square meters, built to the latest KfW efficiency building standard (KfW 55), Ergosign’s new headquarters was unveiled at Europaallee 20a in Saarbrücken in 2018 — not far from Ergosign’s first company headquarters from 2008 — with a ceremony followed by a party. On 18 November 2021, we proudly and gladly accepted the architecture award together with our architect, Mario Krämer, from architecture firm FloSundK.
We want to use the award as an opportunity to offer some insight into the design and realization of our company headquarters.
Creating a “place of work” for a team that collaborates with customers and partners both flexibly and collaboratively was one of the challenges. At the same time, the building was also to become a place for shared experiences and events.
How does an architect approach a task like this?
„As an architect, I want to precisely understand the task at hand before I begin a draft. This involves getting to know the people that the building is for and internalizing the intention of the design. It’s important to me to collect as much insight about the eventual users’ everyday work, their experiences in the world of work up to this point and, most of all, suggestions as to what could be improved. A major benefit of this project was that we already knew the team and Ergosign’s working methods well, due to designing the first building.
We see communication within the team, as well as externally, as the most defining characteristic of Ergosign. A team that works together and that is in constant discussion – with one another, clients, and other businesses. The main design approach for the new headquarters included a large central room where the whole Ergosign family could come together.""

""Another thing was clear too. The new Ergosign II building must make a bold statement in its external appearance. The almost black metal façade, with portholes on the sides, is reminiscent of a ship. The Ergosign steamer can only be accessed via a narrow jetty (in this case, the consciously small entrance).
To me, architecture is good when you perceive it without having studied architecture. A building is welcome to polarize, too. I think this aim has been achieved successfully with the Ergosign II building,” says Mario Krämer, FloSundK.

Ergosign was founded in 2000 as a pioneer of UX Design in Germany. Today, we are one of the largest digital agencies focusing on User Experience, and a market leader on the DACH market. The decision to choose a location in the Eurobahnhof district was made back in 2007.
A brief look back: what were things in the new “Quartier Eurobahnhof” district like in 2007? And why did we opt for this location twice?
“We were pioneers in the district too!” said founder and CEO Professor Dieter Wallach, laughing. “In 2007, we broke ground at the Eurobahnhof district — thereby driving the development of what is now a flourishing neighborhood. FloSundK already designed our first company building, which was awarded the developer’s prize by the Chamber of Architects in 2010. Our constant growth meant we needed more space for new team members shortly after moving in. Just one year after the move, additional rented space opposite in the QBUS building was not intended as a permanent solution.
By 2017, it was clear that we would build a new, larger company building — Ergosign II. Luckily, we didn’t have to search for long. We quickly found our new building plot, also on Europaallee, just a few numbers down.
The location is unbeatable: very central and close to the city with plenty of options for our lunch breaks, great infrastructure and perfect connections to public transport. We even developed a solution for the rather tight parking situation with our app xPark xPark which makes it possible for everyone to drive to the office spontaneously and find a parking spot easily.“
Ergosign was able to fall back on its own construction experience. There must be lots of learnings that were applied to the construction of the new, second company building?
""Absolutely! There’s a lot that we have learned and done better this time,” says Dieter. “Including that some ideas might sound impressive in a meeting and even on paper, but they’re just not practical in everyday life. We discuss, call and Zoom a lot. We especially wanted a solution that would save us the effort of looking for a free meeting room. The first building had a “telephone cubicle”. A square of sturdy red fabric secured to the ceiling with steel cables floated in the open-plan office. It contained a small workplace that offered sound insulation and privacy to make telephone calls. And it was a real visual highlight. Although it was sadly impractical in practice, so never used. We have learned from it. The new building has a “room within a room” as a telephone box in the large offices. Complete with windows, sound insulation and air conditioning, it can play host to ad hoc meetings — even when these conversations are not intended for everyone’s ears.“
Designing the perfect company building can be compared to our approach in UX projects surprisingly well. We typically begin our client projects with a research phase. Before a concept can be established, we accompany, observe and interview the eventual users to understand their needs and conclude requirements for the design concept from these. Designing our building without involving the users was unthinkable for us.
> „Design balances user requirements, technology and economy.“
„Design balances user requirements, technology and economy” is one of Dieter’s guiding principles. Requirements can often contradict one another — a collaborative approach helps us find the optimal balance.
A team plans together. That sounds exciting and a little complicated. What does “collaboration” mean when constructing a new company building?
Markus Schwetje explains, “it was exciting and very productive. We first founded internal task forces, with all departments and experience levels represented. Interim results were introduced and feedback collected. With the help of regular meetings and digital boards, the group developed ideas and specific suggestions that were then discussed with the architects.
Of course, the roughly 100 other team members at the Saarbrücken site were also constantly informed about the plans and, later, construction progress. We were actively involved in each phase of construction.”
> „We don’t want open-plan offices“
What was the most significant change wanted by the team? And would we do it again?
„There was a clear message: we don’t want open-plan offices,” says Christian Grieger, Head of Site at Saarbrücken. “Design and Development sit next to each other. Splitting up the space into offices with two to five people — depending on size — allows quiet yet still collaborative work and encourages the exchange of expertise. Even the introduction of temporary project offices proved popular.
We’d make the decision to move away from large open-plan offices again, any time!
Another requirement we realized was the design of dedicated creative rooms. Spaces to give the mind room for innovative ideas, far removed from utilitarian meeting room setups. Each room was designed to a particular theme by the employees themselves — from a markedly comfortable, cozy room with carpet and a velvet couch to an industrial look and even a room completely without technology and screens.“

From the outside, the building is a real eye-catcher with its iconic look and feel. The dark metal facade, round portholes on the sides and the large window front facing the train station.
How did this unusual facade come about?
“The large window front is actually one of the key elements of Ergosign II’s design concept. It reflects the importance of the building’s communicative center that lies behind it. To an extent, the window front opens and illuminates the space where encounters as well as both formal and informal exchanges take place within the framework of Ergosign’s human-centered work culture in the most obvious way,” says Dr. Marcus Plach, co-founder and CEO along with Dieter.
“The dark metal facade and its irregularly arranged slats give the surface a softer or harder texture depending on the sunlight, creating a dynamic contrast to the dark, elegant overall impression. The association of the portholes, i.e. with an object that is constantly moving, is absolutely intended.“
Ergosign II is not just impressive from the outside. There’s plenty going on indoors too. Let’s take a look at the interior: what does the building look like inside? What makes it so special?
„In contrast to the exterior, I’d describe the interior as bright and friendly. When you enter the building, an open staircase leads upstairs while the light-flooded forum provides a warm welcome,” explains Marie-Claire Harnasch enthusiastically.
View of the stairwell and our large kitchen
„The large room with open kitchen and stage is the heart and communicative center of the building. Plenty of seating invites you to chat with colleagues over a coffee or tea.”
Each Friday, the forum is transformed into an event location. Everyone meets for a communal lunch and there is a Lunch & Learn talk on the stage, sometimes held by team members and sometimes by external speakers.
Stage in use, whether at the Group Focus Time or weekly Lunch & Learn
„I think it’s great that these kinds of company rituals have impacted the building’s architecture and that space has been created for them,” continues Marie. “The company building’s clear structure is emphasized. In my view, the symmetrical design and clear divisions have resulted in workplaces of equal quality for all employees. Unlike other office buildings, we don’t have long, empty corridors leading to closed rooms. Instead, each floor has a different purpose at its core while additional offices are separated. I like to stretch my legs around the building and constantly bump into a colleague that might be sitting in one of the seating booths located in all of the building’s heavy traffic areas.

My personal highlight: our roof terrace! Lots of space, fresh air and a great view of Saarbrücken. Especially in spring and summer, it’s a great place to take a lunch break or have a beer after work together.“
> „External calm and internal variety form the framework for this impressive place of work, on the successful implementation of which one can only congratulate the team of developer and architect. - Jury for the “Orte der Arbeit” Saarland architecture award 2021“
Events and communal experiences define Ergosign’s company culture. That’s why it was important to have sufficient space for events in the building. They say all the best parties take place in the kitchen. Can our new building keep up with that?
„Communication, discussion and team spirit are essential to Ergosign’s culture. And which is known to be the best place to chat and celebrate? That’s right, the kitchen. Even at our roofing ceremony, a band played in our kitchen, although there wasn’t actually a kitchen in there at the time. Our new office building offers great options inside and out, from opening ceremonies to Christmas parties, conferences, Group Focus Time, and events with external guests. Everyone knows how important personal interaction is, especially since Coronavirus,” says Christine Gottlieb, who is responsible for corporate communication and events.

Good communication needs good acoustics, whether in a meeting, at a talk, or listening to live music. Acoustics played a vital role in our interior design, which was a particular challenge in the forum. Extensive 3D models were used to calculate reverberation time and absorption to ensure that speech can always be heard clearly, everywhere in the long, tall room. The results flowed into the conception of the acoustically effective wooden cladding as well as stage and sound technology. The wood also creates a harmonious balance between steel, glass and concrete.
Fun fact #instafam: the building is regularly used as a focal point for private Instagram photo shoots. What was your favorite moment?
„Groups of mostly young women in front of the windows can distract some people from their work,” says Anna Polzin of her spot directly in the window on the ground floor. “From checking their makeup in the glass to that ever-popular duck face to sneaker product shoots — it never gets boring! The blinds are a welcome shield to stop you from becoming an unwilling internet star.“
#### Our resume
Technological change is not an autonomous process — people design it.
A place of work should support people and add to their daily lives, just like digitization. Successful, sustainable change requires a pioneering spirit, a holistic perspective, collaboration and good partners.
Being awarded the architecture prize underlines our values, to which we will continue to remain true in the future.
We would like to thank Mario, Jens, the whole FloSundK architektur + urbanistik GmbH architecture firm, the GUI, the OBG, the Ergosign team and, of course, all those countless hard-working hands that made our plans reality.
We’re already looking forward to the construction of the next building.

#### We are being awarded the “Orte der Arbeit” Saarland architecture prize
Awarded by the Saarland Ministry of Economics every two years, this architectural prize focuses on the theme of “places of work” in 2021.

19/05/2021 • 5 minutes reading time
A turbulent 2020 ended with the first release of the new major version 6 of well-known UI framework Qt. We take a closer look at the new version.
Around eight years after the transition to version 5, many are greeting the new version 6 with suspicion. Technical challenges cannot be ruled out when switching versions - progress involves change, after all. What’s more, the update comes with far-reaching changes to the licensing model. The announcement that LTS versions would be reserved for commercial users is fueling doubt as to the framework’s future. Voices from the open source sector in particular are not mincing their words. But first thing’s first…
#### The Qt Company
Originally part of Norwegian company Trolltech, the framework was sold to Nokia then Digia. It was renamed “The Qt Company” in 2014 and finally listed on the market. Regardless, Qt’s development was ideal, and it is now an integral part of software development. Despite many strategic and technical changes, the framework enjoys a high level of popularity, not least thanks to the large open source community and variety of application options.
The changes surrounding this new release aim to cover the broad needs of the framework’s diverse user scenarios.
#### The Qt Design Studio and design development workflow
#### In the new major version, the Qt Design Studio concentrates primarily on improvements to the interface and intends to further close the gap between design and development. The 3D support already integrated into the Qt Design Studio is getting an integrated 3D editor that can now be used to add 3D elements to classic UIs.
> At Ergosign, we use Qt Design relatively rarely. Not least because our characteristic Ergosign design-development workflow cannot be limited to one single framework in our daily work.
Here is more about Development at Ergosign.
Cross-compatibility and scalability are still Qt’s key characteristics. Applications range from whole desktop suites to embedded systems, from mobile applications on thousands of smartphones to complex machine controls used by a handful of specialists.
The release of Qt 6 both supports and drives this diversification. It is, therefore, no wonder that the biggest technical changes include the support of desC++17 standards and CMake as a build system. A new graphic abstraction layer uncouples Qt from OpenGI and the Qt core module has been treated to a few interesting improvements.
#### What improvements does the new graphics abstraction layer bring?
The Qt Rendering Hardware Interface is an interesting strategic decision from The Qt Company. Up to now, Qt has only used OpenGL as hardware-supported graphics acceleration.
As an abstraction layer, the QRHI regulates access to native graphic interfaces for the relevant runtime environment and also offers a coherent interface for the application.
> We often offer our clients support in the evaluation of hardware and libraries for their specific use cases
So the opportunity to use something else as well as OpenGL is fundamentally great. OpenGL will, however, remain the first choice among Linux.
#### What else does Qt 6 have?
The opportunity to use CMake instead of QMake as a build system has existed for quite some time - they are both equally represented in our everyday project work. However, Qt has always used the more lightweight QMake up to this point. CMake has now taken over QMake as default, and Qt 6 itself was built with CMake.
For the projects currently using QMake as their build system, this change is rather uninteresting. If you are currently in a release cycle, transitioning at this point is not necessary as Qt has announced it will support QMake as a build system throughout the whole of this major version. For new projects with Qt 6, whereby Qt is built from the sources itself, CMake is now unavoidable.
Alongside the major changes already outlined, Qt 6 comes with plenty of changes to individual modules. The Qt Container classes and Concurrency Handling have been overhauled and Qt now has additional styles for a native look & feel for Windows and MacOS applications. The expansion of the QML binding concept, which can now also be used in C++, is promising too.
#### Open source vs. commercial license
With the new version, The Qt Company has also introduced a new license policy. They differentiate between free open-source licenses and commercial licenses. Only the commercial license offers static linking to Qt libraries and access to LTS versions. For open-source license users, this means more regular upgrading to the latest version.
The majority of Qt modules comes under GPLv3, with tivoization explicitly prohibited.
Dynamic linking is unproblematic in desktop applications, as libraries can simply be exchanged via the relevant operating system. However, exchanging libraries for our clients with embedded projects is again a cause for concern. Publishing the source code is not enough to comply with the license. There must be the technical possibility of exchanging the source code. When it comes to technological decisions in an embedded context, it is usually difficult to allow the user to exchange the source code. The question of the commercial license is cropping up more frequently here.  

#### What does a commercial license cost?
The cost of a commercial desktop license can simply be calculated on the Qt website — a monthly sum is charged per developer.
The license costs for embedded systems are less transparent. The commercial license for embedded systems is based on developer licenses on one hand and distribution costs related to the product’s sales volume on the other. Qt provides no clues for either. After all, sales volume (and product price) can vary greatly in various contexts. The sales volume of a consumer product with integrated application ranges in the hundreds of thousands but embedded systems in an industrial context can only be compared to an extent, and the number of sold elements may be in the low double figures but one device may cost millions.
####  **  
**To sum it up: is updating to Qt 6.0 worth it?
As always in life… it depends.  
Based on experience, many of our clients tend to be cautious and wary of major version updates, as both costs and problems can be significant. A new major version contains even more substantial changes, so the porting of existing Qt applications is delayed either way.
Other than Qt, there are few alternatives when it comes to embedded systems, and the uncertainty surrounding costs and licenses is frequently leading to decisions to eschew the framework. Based on experience, development is around 30% more efficient with Qt in comparison to web development. This argument is often not enough without an estimation of the actual license costs.
> Depending on the project, evaluating the individual aspects and requirements with our clients is unavoidable. And such a meaningful evaluation is possible through dialogue - even with The Qt Company.
All in all, Qt 6.0 comes with many positive changes made at the right time. C++17 is now four years old and CMake has long become a standard. QT’s strategy of positioning itself as a central, network-forming building block between various application options and of bringing together developers, designers, users, and maintainers is understandable. But it remains to be seen to what extent the license policy will impact the framework’s future.

Here is more about Development at Ergosign.
Cross-compatibility and scalability are still Qt’s key characteristics. Applications range from whole desktop suites to embedded systems, from mobile applications on thousands of smartphones to complex machine controls used by a handful of specialists.
The release of Qt 6 both supports and drives this diversification. It is, therefore, no wonder that the biggest technical changes include the support of desC++17 standards and CMake as a build system. A new graphic abstraction layer uncouples Qt from OpenGI and the Qt core module has been treated to a few interesting improvements.
#### What improvements does the new graphics abstraction layer bring?
The Qt Rendering Hardware Interface is an interesting strategic decision from The Qt Company. Up to now, Qt has only used OpenGL as hardware-supported graphics acceleration.
As an abstraction layer, the QRHI regulates access to native graphic interfaces for the relevant runtime environment and also offers a coherent interface for the application.
> We often offer our clients support in the evaluation of hardware and libraries for their specific use cases
So the opportunity to use something else as well as OpenGL is fundamentally great. OpenGL will, however, remain the first choice among Linux.
#### What else does Qt 6 have?
The opportunity to use CMake instead of QMake as a build system has existed for quite some time - they are both equally represented in our everyday project work. However, Qt has always used the more lightweight QMake up to this point. CMake has now taken over QMake as default, and Qt 6 itself was built with CMake.
For the projects currently using QMake as their build system, this change is rather uninteresting. If you are currently in a release cycle, transitioning at this point is not necessary as Qt has announced it will support QMake as a build system throughout the whole of this major version. For new projects with Qt 6, whereby Qt is built from the sources itself, CMake is now unavoidable.
Alongside the major changes already outlined, Qt 6 comes with plenty of changes to individual modules. The Qt Container classes and Concurrency Handling have been overhauled and Qt now has additional styles for a native look & feel for Windows and MacOS applications. The expansion of the QML binding concept, which can now also be used in C++, is promising too.
#### Open source vs. commercial license
With the new version, The Qt Company has also introduced a new license policy. They differentiate between free open-source licenses and commercial licenses. Only the commercial license offers static linking to Qt libraries and access to LTS versions. For open-source license users, this means more regular upgrading to the latest version.
The majority of Qt modules comes under GPLv3, with tivoization explicitly prohibited.
Dynamic linking is unproblematic in desktop applications, as libraries can simply be exchanged via the relevant operating system. However, exchanging libraries for our clients with embedded projects is again a cause for concern. Publishing the source code is not enough to comply with the license. There must be the technical possibility of exchanging the source code. When it comes to technological decisions in an embedded context, it is usually difficult to allow the user to exchange the source code. The question of the commercial license is cropping up more frequently here.  

#### What does a commercial license cost?
The cost of a commercial desktop license can simply be calculated on the Qt website — a monthly sum is charged per developer.
The license costs for embedded systems are less transparent. The commercial license for embedded systems is based on developer licenses on one hand and distribution costs related to the product’s sales volume on the other. Qt provides no clues for either. After all, sales volume (and product price) can vary greatly in various contexts. The sales volume of a consumer product with integrated application ranges in the hundreds of thousands but embedded systems in an industrial context can only be compared to an extent, and the number of sold elements may be in the low double figures but one device may cost millions.
####  **  
**To sum it up: is updating to Qt 6.0 worth it?
As always in life… it depends.  
Based on experience, many of our clients tend to be cautious and wary of major version updates, as both costs and problems can be significant. A new major version contains even more substantial changes, so the porting of existing Qt applications is delayed either way.
Other than Qt, there are few alternatives when it comes to embedded systems, and the uncertainty surrounding costs and licenses is frequently leading to decisions to eschew the framework. Based on experience, development is around 30% more efficient with Qt in comparison to web development. This argument is often not enough without an estimation of the actual license costs.
> Depending on the project, evaluating the individual aspects and requirements with our clients is unavoidable. And such a meaningful evaluation is possible through dialogue - even with The Qt Company.
All in all, Qt 6.0 comes with many positive changes made at the right time. C++17 is now four years old and CMake has long become a standard. QT’s strategy of positioning itself as a central, network-forming building block between various application options and of bringing together developers, designers, users, and maintainers is understandable. But it remains to be seen to what extent the license policy will impact the framework’s future.

A turbulent 2020 ended with the first release of the new major version 6 of well-known UI framework Qt. We take a closer look at the new version.
Around eight years after the transition to version 5, many are greeting the new version 6 with suspicion. Technical challenges cannot be ruled out when switching versions - progress involves change, after all. What’s more, the update comes with far-reaching changes to the licensing model. The announcement that LTS versions would be reserved for commercial users is fueling doubt as to the framework’s future. Voices from the open source sector in particular are not mincing their words. But first thing’s first…
#### The Qt Company
Originally part of Norwegian company Trolltech, the framework was sold to Nokia then Digia. It was renamed “The Qt Company” in 2014 and finally listed on the market. Regardless, Qt’s development was ideal, and it is now an integral part of software development. Despite many strategic and technical changes, the framework enjoys a high level of popularity, not least thanks to the large open source community and variety of application options.
The changes surrounding this new release aim to cover the broad needs of the framework’s diverse user scenarios.
#### The Qt Design Studio and design development workflow
#### In the new major version, the Qt Design Studio concentrates primarily on improvements to the interface and intends to further close the gap between design and development. The 3D support already integrated into the Qt Design Studio is getting an integrated 3D editor that can now be used to add 3D elements to classic UIs.

The cry for a meaningful app for the Apple Watch has been resounding since the product was released by the community. But it has gone rather quiet now. One of the reasons for this may be that the Apple Watch is not exploiting its full potential as a typical lifestyle product, but rather that it is being used in other areas. The best example of this is the medical sector.
In no other area is as much research being done into the meaningful use of smartwatches. Many American hospitals are already using the Apple Watch in pilot projects to record their patients’ vital data. Indeed, another article reported on the case of Ken Robson, who noticed that his heartbeat was irregular thanks to his Apple Watch. He took himself and his Apple Watch to the hospital, which confirmed his self-diagnosis. Additionally, he didn’t have to wear a heart monitor for one week, since the watch provided the necessary data. As a result of these circumstances, Mr. Robson could be operated on almost immediately. For us at Ergosign (as UX designers), it is also a matter close to our hearts that the Apple Watch is considered as more than just a nice gadget, but rather that it decisively improves people’s lives as a result of the new opportunities it offers.
The first project we implemented for the Apple Watch is an extension of our medical study Quiri, a pain assessment software for children and young people. The aim of this phase of the project was to tap into adults as a target group too.
Pain therapy with the Apple Watch
#### Why the Apple Watch?
#### 1. A Hardware Basis
Similar to the iPhone, the number of devices for which development has to be carried out is manageable. The watch is only available in two variants (38mm and 42mm) that differ only in terms of their display size. Both versions’ performance is the same.
#### 2. The Hardware Sensors
It provides all the project-relevant hardware sensors.
#### 3. The Distribution
Apple is dominating the market with an estimated more than 50% share. 3 This means that if a patient in pain has a smartwatch, it is highly likely that it is an Apple Watch.
#### 4. The HealthKit
With the HealthKit, the data collected (movement, heart rate, etc.) can be efficiently exchanged within a network of Apple devices.
Reminder: Take your medication
#### Adults are not Children
Even though we may (fortunately) have a different impression, adults are not children and their product requirements are fundamentally different from a child’s. Quiri was designed to assess pain in children and young people, to log these measurements in a chronological relationship and to present them in a prepared manner for the medical professional. While this may also be the goal when it comes to adults, interaction with the application must be tailored to an adult’s life.
#### Small Display, Big Benefits
While the small display may appear restrictive at first glance, if they have been thought-out smaller display sizes lead to better designs, as was announced by Lukas Mathis in “Mobile First” back in 2011:
> „Losing that much screen space forces teams to focus. You have to make sure that what stays on the screen is the most important set of features for your customers and your business. There simply isn’t room for any interface debris or content of questionable value. You need to know what matters most.4
That’s why the Apple Watch cannot be considered a miniature iPhone. Indeed, the nature and location of the interaction, as well as the duration of the interaction itself, are very different from the iPhone. We mustn’t make the mistake of trying to completely reproduce an iPhone app on the Apple Watch. Rather, we have to try to extract meaningful functions and prepare them for use with the watch.
Functions of the app on the Apple Watch
But the Apple Watch offers a great deal more in addition to the display which is seemingly too small. Never has a smart device been closer to the body, and never has it been more possible to generate a constant stream of relevant data. And without any assistance from the user whatsoever. Doctors now have access to a wide variety of data which previously was either impossible to obtain, or could only be obtained with a great deal of time and effort. New relationships that were only based on the patient’s statements beforehand can be formed using this data.
#### The user, Not the Pain, at the Center
The most important aspect of placing the user at the center of the analysis and identifying their needs was also considered when designing Quiri for the Apple Watch. Here, we were very fortunate that we were able to get the Outpatient Pain Clinic of the Saarland University Medical Center on board as a partner. Thanks to Dr. Bialas, Head of the Outpatient Pain Clinic, we were able to gain key insights into the (everyday) life of patients in pain. Additionally, he was able to explain to us what data was important at what level of regularity and at what time to support and improve his pain therapy.
Validation of the Quiri Apple Watch extension
This illustrates yet again just how important proximity to the user is when it comes to designing and developing software.
In the analysis, it quickly became apparent that – in adult pain therapy, unlike child pain therapy – no regular measurements are taken at fixed times. It is far more helpful to set a marker for acute pain, to query various parameters and to automatically record all relevant vital data. Equally important is the querying of positive events, so as to recognize progress made by new medication or measures.
#### Things Have to Be Done Quickly
Apple specifies an average interaction duration of 5 seconds for the watch. This poses something of a challenge for the design, since the parameters of pain severity, pain quality and trigger (anger, stress, injury, etc.) absolutely must be queried to enable therapy improvement. Input from the user is required for this purpose. Nevertheless, we were keen to enable the patient to assess their pain casually or when suffering from pain too. We tried to take that into account by automatically recording a multitude of environmental variables and vital data, and by having clear direction due to the individual functions.
UI on the Apple Watch for Quiri
Unlike the main application, which provides an overview of the measurements taken and extensive pain questionnaires, the range of functions for the watch app was reduced to the absolute essentials. The watch app allows patients in pain to set a marker if they are experiencing acute pain or positive events, to log the intake of medication and the occurrence of side-effects, and to see the type and quantity of medication prescribed by the doctor. The patient is also reminded to take their medication by the app.
#### Conclusion
This first project has shown us that the Apple Watch, or smartwatches in general, harbor a great deal of potential. Quiri has already been superbly complemented by the watch and we will be sure to think of how we can meaningfully use smartwatches in other projects too. Dr. Bialas was also positive in his assessment:
> „Telemedicine has become an integral part of society. Once the teething troubles have been overcome and data can be transmitted securely, this form of data exchange will provide good support for chronically ill patients. Particularly in view of the age structure (people in Germany are getting older), data can be transmitted quickly to the doctors treating them, who can then start treatment if necessary. With Quiri for the Apple Watch, the developers have created a very good tool. Keep up the good work.” Dr. Bialas
We are looking forward to the next flatter and faster versions of smartwatches with longer battery lives and to other projects with and for smartwatches.

Alongside oil and plastic, ghost nets are a significant factor in the pollution of oceans, lakes and rivers. These ghost nets are abandoned fishing nets, predominantly made from long-lasting plastic fibers, that haunt water for decades while endangering ecosystems and all life within them. An unfathomable 640,000 tons of fishing nets are either lost or illegally dumped in the water each year (source: 
This article not only covers the global issue of ghost nets but also a solution approach that we at Ergosign would like to support: we are using speculative design methods and prototyping to design a realistic deposit system for fishing nets.
#### The causes
A study on behalf of the European Commission identified the following causes that are responsible for fishing nets being left in the ocean:
  * Lack of incentive: fishing companies don’t take the materials back.
  * Lack of infrastructure to dispose of used and broken fishing nets.
  * Little sense of responsibility among producers and fishing supply companies for proper disposal.

What do ghost nets and water pollution have to do with Ergosign? Why are we spending time thinking about things that don’t have anything to do with digital products and our services at first glance? It’s simple:
> We are more than ‘just’ a digital UX design agency. In our projects, we find solutions for problems and challenges that vary immensely. We are, like in this case, experts in comprehending the circumstances of various different industries and sectors.
As the impacts of ghost nets affect us all, our goal is to show how technology and design can be used to come up with meaningful solution approaches.
#### Designing solutions with speculative design
As well as the cause of the problem, the European Commission has also had solutions investigated. A deposit system has been identified as a favorite option, similar to the bottle deposit system in place in many European countries. The aims are as follows:
  * Reduce ghost nets in the water and protect the environment through suitable motivators.
  * Facilitate realizable optimizations of existing infrastructure.
  * Employ economical solutions that can be implemented in a scalable way.
  * Set up fair conditions for fishing communities and society.
  * To develop this deposit system, we are using speculative design methods.


> Speculative design methods are generally used as inspiration and in discussions regarding solution approaches to wider societal problems. Speculative design intends to elicit actions to impact existing products and services as well as our culture and ecosystems in a solution-oriented way.

We begin with an analysis of the current product life cycle. Where do these nets come from, what do they look like, what conditions are they subjected to, how are they used, where and how do they leave the cycle?
We are basing our fundamental concept on the promising option of a deposit model for fishing equipment that the European Commission has selected as preferred.
First, we visualized the nets’ current cycle and infrastructure. Then we looked for suitable technology to act as a driver in this challenging case. Based on this, we created a product journey map to visualize implementation and outline the infrastructure changes required by the deposit model.
To create the necessary incentives and reduce the strain on the environment in the long run, our implementation goal is as follows:
  * Technologically supported implementation of a deposit model
  * Smart networks for documentation of existing supply chain to promote traceability
  * Design of a closed life cycle and circular economy system through recycling and upcycling processes
  * Technology realizable in the medium term as a driver of process innovation
  * Economically realizable processes and contact points for companies in this economic sector


We outline technical feasibility in a proof of concept regarding the product - in this case, fishing nets - as well as the development of a digital service touchpoint.
Hands-on: implementation specifics
A significant part of our solution is making fishing nets “smart”. As our technological basis, we have decided to use NFC - near field communication - tags. These facilitate documentation throughout the net’s life cycle, as well as the development of a product deposit system.
A fishing net offers few options to integrate technology. At the same time, water is also a challenging implementation site. NFC tags, which can consist of no more than a small wire, are an optimal solution thanks to their small size and exceptional resilience.
NFC tags work via induction, so no need for regular charging or communication frequencies that can be impacted by the environment. They also offer the opportunity to read and write small quantities of data. The costs of producing NFC tags, as well as the writing and reading devices required throughout the supply chain, are low and economically feasible.
We integrated these NFC tags into the weights on the fishing nets. So they do not impact the product or its function.
The NFC tags contain a reference to a database. This means data about the net, the deposit paid and the net’s life cycle can be documented.

#### The concept of a closed cycle
In our concept, a monetary deposit is paid each time a net is purchased. The net deposit can be charged upon purchase and refunded upon return. During predefined phases of the fishing net’s supply chain, the status of this net and the relevant phase can be documented using the writing tools positioned within the process (e.g., upon purchase and on the boat). This means it is always possible to see when the net was sold or cast out.
The deposit system allows incentives to be integrated into the process. Paying the deposit creates motivation for fishing businesses to return the net. To create additional incentives, the deposit has been calculated to exceed the costs of returning the net. The costs are fairly distributed, however, as the deposit is refunded. The deposit system enables returns, facilitating a closed life cycle.
This closed life cycle is supplemented by corresponding return points in infrastructure, e.g., near harbors. Accompanying upcycling and recycling processes can be coordinated and measurably established through the closed system.
If the net is lost, two possible effects are created. As the net’s last location of use was documented, its position can be tracked, facilitating targeted recovery. The deposit can also be motivation for other parties: this could encourage the removal of large numbers of nets from the water - with a profitable reward.
In the future, documentation could also log who lost a net and which fisheries are looking for the net.
#### Summary
These technologies make “old” products smart, creating sustainable solutions for our environment. Our solution draft shows the use of NFC tags in fishing nets as the basis for a complete recycling system.
The integration of cheap technology facilitates the economically feasible implementation of these processes as well as fair cost distribution. The result is the formation of sustainable motivators through the removal of essential hurdles, reducing strain on the environment by creating a circular economy. We also used the scenario to further develop our own understanding of a new design method by taking a comprehensive approach to a global problem.
For clean oceans with fewer ghost nets and a sustainable contribution to our planet!

Instead of taking a packed bus, simply order an autonomous shuttle on demand via an app to quickly and conveniently get to your destination. Sound far-fetched?
That’s the idea behind “APEROL”. Not just the name of a popular drink, it’s also the acronym for the “APEROL
#### APEROL and the Future of Mobility
Road traffic is undergoing a process of transformation. These days some solutions for electromobility in cities are already visible: renting eScooters using an app is just one example. Even the issue of autonomous driving (traveling in driverless vehicles) is all over the media, conjuring up high expectations as to the way in which people will be moving and goods be transported in the future. To meet these expectations, cohesive solution concepts are needed that take the individual requirements of citizens and businesses into account.
In developing human-centered concepts for the mobility of the future for APEROL, Ergosign is working closely with partners from research and industry. Among the project partners the chairs of i5, WZL, ICE and HCIC at the RWTH Aachen, the Institute for Software Systems at Trier University, e.Go mobile AG, PSI Logistics GmbH, MAT.TRAFFIC GmbH and the City of Aachen are represented.

#### The Project’s Central Elements and Core Issues
At the beginning of the project, we joined our partners to work out the project’s main challenges. Of course, it all boils down to software development in the end - but we first wanted to completely understand the problem and establish our approach. The discussion covered citizen participation (“What do citizens expect from an autonomous system of this nature?”), possible pilot and test operations (on dedicated test grounds and later Aachen’s infrastructure), the creation of a simulation environment and the analysis of our solutions’ transferability to other cities.
In more specific terms, the Ergosign team dealt with the following questions:
  * How can autonomous driving be used efficiently to transport people and goods?
  * How can potential passengers interact with the autonomous driving service before, during and after the journey?
  * How can future mobility concepts be efficiently conceptualized across various disciplines and companies?
  * How can human-machine interfaces be developed and evaluated for autonomous vehicles?


#### Collaborative UX Design in Project APEROL
The development of a mobility service requires close, coordinated collaboration between Ergosign and the industry/research partners involved. Countless factors have to be kept in mind in the scenario in question: planning the journeys, logistical organization, the combination of various user routes, taking remaining battery charge into consideration, inter-vehicle communication, interaction between passengers and autonomous vehicle etc.  
In the interdisciplinary cooperation across the participating project partners we apply methods of Collaborative UX Design. The photo shows a concept workshop at Ergosign’s headquarters in Saarbrücken. See our Insights article [Collaborative UX Design-Workshops 1 and 2](https://www.ergosign.de/en/insights/2019/article-collaborative-workshops-part1.html) to find out about these methods in more detail.
> ""The methodical approach in the concept workshop allowed a goal-oriented discussion of technical and design matters across the boundaries of disciplines and companies. At the same time, this created an open, motivating atmosphere.""

But the concepts and the assumptions they are based on need to be reviewed beforehand. In the sense of the human-centered design process, this took place iteratively - across all development phases. The major aim is to create usable systems that result in a positive user experience. Involving potential users and analyzing their requirements increases the system’s effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability as well as human wellbeing in relation to the service - promising a satisfied user in the end. The use context takes on a vital role especially when deriving user needs as well as the design and evaluation based on these.We were met with a few hurdles when evaluating our concepts on autonomous driving. Real attempts to test the systems in a use context are not only very labor-intensive but also expensive and only possible in very restricted scenarios. So we’re purposefully working on solutions for the cost-effective evaluation of our concepts, contextualizing even in the early phases.
#### To sum it up
APEROL’s aim is to offer solutions to the “first and last mile” issue of public transport. To this end, Ergosign is creating interfaces between humans and machines, and analyzing these constantly. In future work sections, the app design and development will be evaluated and validated.

APEROL’s aim is to offer solutions to the “first and last mile” issue of public transport. To this end, Ergosign is creating interfaces between humans and machines, and analyzing these constantly. In future work sections, the app design and development will be evaluated and validated.
Addendum:_  
_The project is being funded under the “automated and networked driving” funding guideline of the Federal Ministry for Road Traffic and Digital Infrastructure with a total contribution of €4,691,277.

To understand users, their behavior, prior knowledge and needs, two proven methodological approaches can be distinguished: observation in a situational context and conducting interviews. This may sound easy — yet by no means is it trivial, as some may believe. That is why we have specially trained colleagues in this field who are well versed in the methods of user research.
One things is clear: User research is indispensable for truly aligning design with the needs of users in design that is user centered. For only if (future) users are actually involved in the design process can we ensure that an application fits the identified needs and is easy to use. In the event that user research is neglected in the course of a project, the concept is based on untested assumptions and runs the risk of being designer-centric rather than user-centric: Even UX designers are not immune to self-referential design.
> Compared to traditional user research, service design goes a step further and involves not only users but also all other stakeholders within the company in the research and design process to develop a holistic solution. More details on service design and strategy are available [**here**](https://www.ergosign.de/en/services/service-design.html).
#### What research can achieve
User researchers play a key role in UX projects because they ensure that the concepts are developed on an evidence-driven (or put in modern terms: data-driven) basis. In order to test assumptions about users, their experience, the system, or the application context during a project, user researchers rely on methodological knowledge to formulate hypotheses:
  * How prospective users interact with a system.
  * Which challenges they (may) encounter.
  * Which Pain Points arise and how they can be avoided.
  * Which parameters can be used to test the hypotheses.


To properly and correctly verify hypotheses, suitable methods must be selected and applied. We present an extract of methods that help to better understand user behavior in the following:
#### Methods
Selection and combination
Depending on the project phase, UX professionals are confronted with different questions.  
At the start, it is often a matter of gaining a precise understanding of the user (groups), the context of use, the work objectives and the corresponding requirements and needs, as well as discovering new possibilities. Job shadowing in combination with interviews is especially well-suited for this purpose. Concepts and design can be checked using Usability tests and iteratively adapted based on user feedback in order to improve product quality and acceptance.
> Simply “asking"" in a non-application-related situation is often not sufficient. For there is a discrepancy between what people do and what they claim or believe they do. In that circumstance, observing concrete behavior can help to understand everyday use. That is why professional methods are so vital when it comes to obtaining reliable evidence for hypotheses.
Usability und UX testings
In a usability test, participants perform typical (work) tasks with a system. Our researchers accompany this test and ask specific questions. This way, we gain deeper insights that allow us to derive concrete approaches for improvement from current behavior.
> Users do not always have to be on site for a usability test; remote surveys are also possible. An illustrative article on “Agile remote testing and candidate recruitment” for tests is available [**here**](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/agiles-remote-testing/).
In a usability test, UX researchers act both as moderators and observers. During implementation, it is often of great benefit if the responsible designers - and possibly also the stakeholders on the customer side - are involved and can thus directly understand the application through the users’ eyes.
#### Context analyses
While usability tests often take place in the controlled environment of a laboratory and based on pre-structured tasks, context analyses are carried out in the actual situational application context. This means that work is carried out on site, where the software will later be used. While an interview guide is often used to structure the conversation and observations, the method is based on the idea that UX researchers act as students and learn from the participants. In that way, our researchers obtain detailed and well-founded information on aspects such as the (work) environment, workarounds, artifacts or interactions with colleagues.
#### Inspection methods
... such as cognitive walkthroughs or heuristic evaluations do not necessarily involve the actual users in the design process but should be carried out by people who are very familiar with the domain and are thus in a position to adopt the most authentic user perspective possible. The findings of this method can be quantified by dividing them into categories and levels of severity.
Interview-based methods - such as focus groups, context analyses and usability testing - provide qualitative, i.e. non-numerical data. Ideally, different methods are combined to achieve a deeper understanding. Therefore, for example, we often ask participants to fill out a standardized survey at the end of a usability test session and then check whether the results point in the same direction or interpret deviations based on comprehensive benchmarks.  
In a customer test we discovered some erratic findings; nevertheless, the SUS score (System Usability Scale, a quantitative survey method) of the software had excellent results. The customer hence went live with the product as planned, as no significant experience drops were to be expected, and he subsequently optimized the design.

### Ready? Readi!
Our office in Saarbrücken hosted the kick-off for the research project Readi on March 1st, 2023. To celebrate and to explain the project a little further, we conducted a little interview with project manager Katharina Roos and researcher Dr. Verena Rheinstädter.
#### What is Readi actually about?
Katharina:Readi  
  
There are currently a variety of challenges in the world, such as the shortage of skilled workers, the consequences of the Corona crisis, and the energy crisis. Under the influence of these challenges and crises, small and medium-sized and especially manufacturing companies in Germany, are finding it difficult to deal with change as a permanent condition. Companies also face significant challenges in producing increasingly complex systems and products in ever shorter development and production cycles. This often leads to the question of where to start and, unfortunately, often ends in failed initiatives.  
For more than two decades, we have successfully supported organizations in the transformation towards an independent human-centered development of digital products and services. We are happy to bring this experience to the research project, particularly to reduce the aforementioned hurdles for manufacturing SMEs.  
  
Verena:
Workshop moments
#### What does resilience mean specifically in a corporate context, especially regarding small and medium-sized companies?
Katharina:  
  
Regardless of the level, resilience is always characterized by effectively handling crises and challenges and balancing agility and stability. Of course, it is exciting to see what makes some organizations more resilient than others and what factors contribute to adaptability and resilience. As already mentioned: Today, we are confronted with internal and external changes – from outside, for example, due to the energy crisis or the planned end for combustion engines, especially manufacturing SMEs in Germany. It is inspiring to see how companies counter these changes without losing their original meaning – i.e., their purpose.
#### What goals would you like to achieve with the research project?
Verena:
Readi kick-off event
#### How did the project come about, and what are we contributing to it?
Katharina:  
  
Now, as part of a research project, we can deepen what we have already worked out, apply it across the board and, above all, make the results publicly available so that as many companies as possible can benefit from them. On March 1st, 2023, the official kick-off and the first consortium meeting took place in Saarbrücken, and it was exciting to see how quickly we gathered insights as a team.  
  
Verena:  
  
Through professional associations such as PfalzMetall e.V., which support us as transfer partners, we can expand our projects as much as possible. Of course, we will also bundle our competencies internally and work on the project with the close involvement of our [Industry Solution](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/industry/), our experts for [Organizational Design](https://ergosign.de/en/data/tags/org-design/), and in close cooperation with our [Service Design](https://ergosign.de/en/services/service-design/) experts.

Dr. Lukas Flohr
Esther Barra
Charlotte Osthelder
08/11/2023 • 7 minutes reading time
Automated driving is more and more finding its way into our cities. The technology promises more safety, efficiency and comfort in road traffic - both for drivers and passengers. Research into driverless autonomous vehicles still faces significant challenges, particularly in complex urban environments — from a technical point of view and user acceptance. At Ergosign, we design and develop products and services that support and delight people in their work — human-centered at all times. In the STADT:up project, we can combine our expertise from research in ""autonomous mobility"" with our human-centered design approach and thus make valuable contributions to the future of mobility. In this groundbreaking project, we are working on designing human-centered interaction concepts for the occupants of automated vehicles in everyday traffic situations. Our goal is to address user concerns early, thereby creating a positive and trustworthy user experience.
#### What is STADT:up?
STADT:up is a comprehensive, multi-year collaborative project with 22 partners from industry and research. The project, which started in January 2023, is funded by the German Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz BMWK (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection) and will run until December 2025. STADT: up aims to design consistent, scalable solutions for future urban mobility in which vehicles can navigate safely through complex, inner-city traffic situations. The project develops user-centered concepts and pilot applications for automated driving in urban areas. The focus here is on interactions with vulnerable road users (pedestrians and cyclists) and complex situations, especially in conjunction with AI-based methods. In this workshop report, we would like to provide initial insights into our work at STADT:up.  
That motivated us, that motivated me. But is this the significant change we've collectively envisioned over the past decade that should bring a better world (for our children and us)? Is the big vision still achievable, and how do we get there?
The 5 STADT:up sub projects
#### Human factors and automated driving
STADT:up is structured into five sub-projects. Ergosign is particularly involved in the two sub-projects, „Human Factors“ and „Automated Driving“. In the first sub-project, we are concerned with the design and prototypical development of interaction concepts that support the explanation of automation behavior. The aim is to strengthen vehicle occupants' trust and sense of security in complex inner-city traffic situations. The Automated Driving sub-project focuses on demonstrating these concepts in simulator and real vehicle studies, which we implement in close collaboration with our research partners. We are developing an engineering UI that processes sensor and vehicle information in real-time and thus provides system engineers with valuable information and functions in the development process.
### Human factors — milestones:
#### 1. Literature, context and requirements analysis
With a well-founded literature analysis and related work, we lay a solid foundation for the human-centered development of interaction concepts. In addition to a sense of security and fun-to-use, trust in automated vehicles (AVs) is one of the central challenges in user acceptance. The importance of HMIs in the vehicle should not be underestimated here. In autonomous vehicles, these are irreplaceable as an interface between humans and technology to compensate for the absence of human drivers. To address trust and security concerns, especially in critical situations, adequate system feedback is required, which is communicated via the HMI. For example, the sensor-based perception of the vehicle can be visualized in real-time and thus provide explanations of the system behavior.
In addition to the classic literature evaluation, we always keep an eye on the state of technology and the industry. We continuously analyze existing and new HMI and visualization concepts. The focus is primarily on the conceptual and visual aspects of the interfaces under consideration. We sometimes examine concepts from leading AV and AI technology companies, such as Waymo, Cruise, Baidu, or Mobileye, and examine the representation of the environment, routes, or trajectories and the use of different perspectives. We also look at the interaction of system feedback with other vehicles and route information or additional information elements.
In the spirit of the human-centered design process, we not only talk about the (potential) users but also with them. We combined semi-structured interviews with co-creation methods as part of STADT: up. With these ""co-creation interviews"" we recorded the needs and requirements of future users for the interaction concept. We convert the results into personas and user journeys and derive their targeted design recommendations.
#### 2. Focus scenarios
When developing and evaluating future concepts, we initially focus on four everyday inner-city traffic situations. These scenarios were chosen taking into account the following aspects:
  * High complexity of the inner-city traffic situation,
  * Involvement of vulnerable road users (VRU),
  * Variety of possible situational behaviors,
  * Frequency of the situation in inner-city traffic.


Using the selected scenarios, the complex challenges of inner-city road traffic and the resulting requirements for (internal) information and communication concepts can be presented, analyzed and discussed.
STADT:up szenario scribbles
3. Interaction design: design exploration and initial concepts
We have already transferred the results of a detailed requirements analysis together with the defined scenarios into initial interaction concepts. The concepts developed explain the automation behavior of vehicles understandably and efficiently. Further sub-projects of STADT:up are investigating ways to recognize the intentions of other road users at an early stage. These results will be integrated into our interaction concepts in the future. This way, modular interaction modules are created for internal communication in the vehicle. The modular structure enables relevant information to be distributed to the vehicle occupants depending on the specific context, user group, and active automation level.
Based on the analysis results, the first design ideas are already available in mock-ups and wireframes and will be iteratively developed in the next steps. In the next step, we develop tangible prototypes that are explored and evaluated in simulator and Wizard-of-Oz studies.
## Automated driving - milestones:
To test and demonstrate our concepts, we focus in particular on interactions with vulnerable road users. For efficient collaboration with our project partners, the focus is currently on developing an Engineering UI.
The Engineering UI will have the following tasks, among others:
  * Preparation and visualization of sensor data from partner systems.
  * Providing suitable functions for data acquisition and system demonstration.
  * Configuration and demonstration of HMI modules for end users in the test vehicles.


What have we already achieved? So far, we can report the following about these ambitious goals:
#### 1. Requirements analysis
As part of the project kick-off, Ergosign moderated a world café discussion that provided input on the requirements specification for the Engineering UI from the user's perspective. Building on this, detailed framework conditions and requirements were recorded in various joint workshops and meetings. We bundle the results into personas, journey maps, and problem statement maps. These artifacts lay an essential foundation for the successful conception, development, and integration of the (engineering) UIs.  
We conducted a comprehensive technology and market analysis of available frameworks as part of the requirements analysis. The Robot Operating System (ROS), the debugging and visualization framework (Foxglove), and the tools for visualizing sensor data and researching the required hardware components were particularly exciting. We are coordinating closely with the cooperation partners such as for example the Intelligent Vehicles Lab the Munich University of Applied Sciences, who are setting up test vehicles as part of STADT:up, in which we will integrate our HMI components.
#### 2. Focus scenarios
Ergosign's scenarios were chosen with a focus on vulnerable road users (see above). For the development and integration of the HMIs/UIs, we will also consider the scenarios of the cooperation partners, in whose test vehicles the HMI concepts will be integrated.
#### 3. Interaction design: initial concepts and test set-up
Based on the (continuous) requirements analysis and coordination with the project partners, we carried out the first ideation workshops. We visualized the resulting ideas and concepts in scribbles and initial wireframes. These were used to coordinate with the developers and project partners in future concept workshops. In the further steps, the concepts are converted into initial prototypes, evaluated, optimized if necessary, and finally implemented. The current focus is the Engineering UI to create a lightweight and compact UI for vehicle engineers, developers, and designers. In addition, the Ergosign developer team has already dealt intensively with the framework conditions for integration into the partner test vehicles and implemented its test set-up.
### What is next?
The STADT:up project will run until December 2025 — even though we have already reached some important milestones, we still have some challenges ahead of us. We will regularly share the project's progress here. Stay tuned!

# STADT:up - a visionary research project for autonomous mobility

Automated driving is more and more finding its way into our cities. The technology promises more safety, efficiency and comfort in road traffic - both for drivers and passengers. Research into driverless autonomous vehicles still faces significant challenges, particularly in complex urban environments — from a technical point of view and user acceptance. At Ergosign, we design and develop products and services that support and delight people in their work — human-centered at all times. In the STADT:up project, we can combine our expertise from research in ""autonomous mobility"" with our human-centered design approach and thus make valuable contributions to the future of mobility. In this groundbreaking project, we are working on designing human-centered interaction concepts for the occupants of automated vehicles in everyday traffic situations. Our goal is to address user concerns early, thereby creating a positive and trustworthy user experience.
#### What is STADT:up?
STADT:up is a comprehensive, multi-year collaborative project with 22 partners from industry and research. The project, which started in January 2023, is funded by the German Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz BMWK (Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection) and will run until December 2025. STADT: up aims to design consistent, scalable solutions for future urban mobility in which vehicles can navigate safely through complex, inner-city traffic situations. The project develops user-centered concepts and pilot applications for automated driving in urban areas. The focus here is on interactions with vulnerable road users (pedestrians and cyclists) and complex situations, especially in conjunction with AI-based methods. In this workshop report, we would like to provide initial insights into our work at STADT:up.  
That motivated us, that motivated me. But is this the significant change we've collectively envisioned over the past decade that should bring a better world (for our children and us)? Is the big vision still achievable, and how do we get there?
The 5 STADT:up sub projects
#### Human factors and automated driving
STADT:up is structured into five sub-projects. Ergosign is particularly involved in the two sub-projects, „Human Factors“ and „Automated Driving“. In the first sub-project, we are concerned with the design and prototypical development of interaction concepts that support the explanation of automation behavior. The aim is to strengthen vehicle occupants' trust and sense of security in complex inner-city traffic situations. The Automated Driving sub-project focuses on demonstrating these concepts in simulator and real vehicle studies, which we implement in close collaboration with our research partners. We are developing an engineering UI that processes sensor and vehicle information in real-time and thus provides system engineers with valuable information and functions in the development process.
### Human factors — milestones:
#### 1. Literature, context and requirements analysis
With a well-founded literature analysis and related work, we lay a solid foundation for the human-centered development of interaction concepts. In addition to a sense of security and fun-to-use, trust in automated vehicles (AVs) is one of the central challenges in user acceptance. The importance of HMIs in the vehicle should not be underestimated here. In autonomous vehicles, these are irreplaceable as an interface between humans and technology to compensate for the absence of human drivers. To address trust and security concerns, especially in critical situations, adequate system feedback is required, which is communicated via the HMI. For example, the sensor-based perception of the vehicle can be visualized in real-time and thus provide explanations of the system behavior.
In addition to the classic literature evaluation, we always keep an eye on the state of technology and the industry. We continuously analyze existing and new HMI and visualization concepts. The focus is primarily on the conceptual and visual aspects of the interfaces under consideration. We sometimes examine concepts from leading AV and AI technology companies, such as Waymo, Cruise, Baidu, or Mobileye, and examine the representation of the environment, routes, or trajectories and the use of different perspectives. We also look at the interaction of system feedback with other vehicles and route information or additional information elements.
In the spirit of the human-centered design process, we not only talk about the (potential) users but also with them. We combined semi-structured interviews with co-creation methods as part of STADT: up. With these ""co-creation interviews"" we recorded the needs and requirements of future users for the interaction concept. We convert the results into personas and user journeys and derive their targeted design recommendations.
#### 2. Focus scenarios
When developing and evaluating future concepts, we initially focus on four everyday inner-city traffic situations. These scenarios were chosen taking into account the following aspects:
  * High complexity of the inner-city traffic situation,
  * Involvement of vulnerable road users (VRU),
  * Variety of possible situational behaviors,
  * Frequency of the situation in inner-city traffic.


Using the selected scenarios, the complex challenges of inner-city road traffic and the resulting requirements for (internal) information and communication concepts can be presented, analyzed and discussed.

3. Interaction design: design exploration and initial concepts
We have already transferred the results of a detailed requirements analysis together with the defined scenarios into initial interaction concepts. The concepts developed explain the automation behavior of vehicles understandably and efficiently. Further sub-projects of STADT:up are investigating ways to recognize the intentions of other road users at an early stage. These results will be integrated into our interaction concepts in the future. This way, modular interaction modules are created for internal communication in the vehicle. The modular structure enables relevant information to be distributed to the vehicle occupants depending on the specific context, user group, and active automation level.
Based on the analysis results, the first design ideas are already available in mock-ups and wireframes and will be iteratively developed in the next steps. In the next step, we develop tangible prototypes that are explored and evaluated in simulator and Wizard-of-Oz studies.

A crucial element for the long-term success of any organization is the focused and comprehensive understanding of underlying user needs of both customers and the organization’s employees.
#### Strategic research – identifying new business opportunities
Through strategic research, companies utilize empirical methods to identify new or evolving needs of their customers and users. The insights gained from this research form the foundation for strategic corporate decisions, such as the composition of service and product portfolios or targeting specific customer segments.
User research is an established, integral part of human-centered approaches in developing products and services, providing crucial information on the service range and concrete design. However, at a higher level, for the design of an overarching corporate strategy or the definition of a product and service portfolio, empirically supported decisions are often absent. Information on the general goals and needs of customers and users should be obtained and collected through systematic observations (cf. [1], [2], [3]) to support decision making.
Strategic research aligns the company's vision, goals, and resulting corporate, product, and service strategies with the needs and expectations of customers and users. This ensures that the experiences designed on this basis contribute to achieving corporate goals and — beyond short-term optimization — support competitiveness and long-term success.
> This way, user needs can be recognized - regardless of the current offer of a company - thus uncovering opportunities for products and services.
Unlike traditional user research, which aims to gain a deep understanding of customer and user preferences and needs, strategic research has a broader perspective. This way, user needs can be recognized - regardless of the current offer of a company - thus uncovering opportunities for products and services.  
While market research is primarily driven by business goals focusing on a company's market environment, strategic research mainly aims to gain a deep understanding of the preferences and needs of customers and users. Although market research and strategic research have different focuses, they can complement each other and contribute to developing an effective overall strategy. Based on this, effective and sustainable decisions can be made with foresight, promoting the ability to innovate at the same time. This allows the early recognition of changes and the interpretation of their relevance - so that companies can be agile and adaptable.
#### Promoting an effective and sustainable overall strategy
As part of strategic research, assumptions about the needs of customers and users in the company's specific business area are systematically identified and critically reviewed. Incorrect assumptions can pose significant business risks, so addressing them is crucial. Uncovered assumptions are prioritized, and a research roadmap is planned for their review.
This form of research is conducted independently of pre-existing products, services, and goals, allowing investigations to be carried out with the necessary foresight and care. Methods such as context interviews, shadowing, or diaries are typically used.
Strategic research requires an independent research team that can work independently from existing products, services, or corporate strategies and has the necessary continuity. Involving executives and decision-makers without specific interests in individual, established products or services is essential to ensure the objectivity and impartiality of the research results. Additionally, a suitable platform is necessary to present and explain the results.
#### Focus on people
Ergosign has been helping organizations put people first for more than twenty years. Successful digital products and services are created in human-centered organizations. A maturity assessment by Ergosign helped our customer genua to understand how human-centric the organization is and provided a sound basis for deriving recommendations for the future. This way, informed change processes within a company can be initiated in order to take important steps towards a higher UX maturity. You can find more about the [genua Case Study](https://www.ergosign.de/en/work/case-studies/genua.html).
We actively support companies in dealing with continuous and sometimes unpredictable change through a strong human focus and in emerging stronger from it. In the current research project ""Readi"", funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Research, we at Ergosign, together with other partners, are dealing with this question in detail. Readi stands for: gestärkte Radi[Insights article ](https://www.ergosign.de/en/insights/2023/readi.html).

A crucial element for the long-term success of any organization is the focused and comprehensive understanding of underlying user needs of both customers and the organization’s employees.
#### Strategic research – identifying new business opportunities
Through strategic research, companies utilize empirical methods to identify new or evolving needs of their customers and users. The insights gained from this research form the foundation for strategic corporate decisions, such as the composition of service and product portfolios or targeting specific customer segments.
User research is an established, integral part of human-centered approaches in developing products and services, providing crucial information on the service range and concrete design. However, at a higher level, for the design of an overarching corporate strategy or the definition of a product and service portfolio, empirically supported decisions are often absent. Information on the general goals and needs of customers and users should be obtained and collected through systematic observations (cf. [1], [2], [3]) to support decision making.
Strategic research aligns the company's vision, goals, and resulting corporate, product, and service strategies with the needs and expectations of customers and users. This ensures that the experiences designed on this basis contribute to achieving corporate goals and — beyond short-term optimization — support competitiveness and long-term success.
> This way, user needs can be recognized - regardless of the current offer of a company - thus uncovering opportunities for products and services.
Unlike traditional user research, which aims to gain a deep understanding of customer and user preferences and needs, strategic research has a broader perspective. This way, user needs can be recognized - regardless of the current offer of a company - thus uncovering opportunities for products and services.  
While market research is primarily driven by business goals focusing on a company's market environment, strategic research mainly aims to gain a deep understanding of the preferences and needs of customers and users. Although market research and strategic research have different focuses, they can complement each other and contribute to developing an effective overall strategy. Based on this, effective and sustainable decisions can be made with foresight, promoting the ability to innovate at the same time. This allows the early recognition of changes and the interpretation of their relevance - so that companies can be agile and adaptable.
#### Promoting an effective and sustainable overall strategy
As part of strategic research, assumptions about the needs of customers and users in the company's specific business area are systematically identified and critically reviewed. Incorrect assumptions can pose significant business risks, so addressing them is crucial. Uncovered assumptions are prioritized, and a research roadmap is planned for their review.
This form of research is conducted independently of pre-existing products, services, and goals, allowing investigations to be carried out with the necessary foresight and care. Methods such as context interviews, shadowing, or diaries are typically used.
Strategic research requires an independent research team that can work independently from existing products, services, or corporate strategies and has the necessary continuity. Involving executives and decision-makers without specific interests in individual, established products or services is essential to ensure the objectivity and impartiality of the research results. Additionally, a suitable platform is necessary to present and explain the results.
#### Focus on people
Ergosign has been helping organizations put people first for more than twenty years. Successful digital products and services are created in human-centered organizations. A maturity assessment by Ergosign helped our customer genua to understand how human-centric the organization is and provided a sound basis for deriving recommendations for the future. This way, informed change processes within a company can be initiated in order to take important steps towards a higher UX maturity. You can find more about the [genua Case Study](https://www.ergosign.de/en/work/case-studies/genua.html).
We actively support companies in dealing with continuous and sometimes unpredictable change through a strong human focus and in emerging stronger from it. In the current research project ""Readi"", funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Research, we at Ergosign, together with other partners, are dealing with this question in detail. Readi stands for: gestärkte Radi[Insights article ](https://www.ergosign.de/en/insights/2023/readi.html).

Autonomous vehicles are on the rise and transforming our cities. But how can we ensure that this technology not only works, but also inspires? Understandable Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) are the key. We have been participating in the collaborative research project [STADT:up](https://www.ergosign.de/de/insights/blog/stadt-up) to develop solutions for autonomous urban mobility since January 2023. Our goal is to create technologies and concepts that enable automated and autonomous driving in urban environments. At Ergosign, we focus on designing human-machine interaction to sustainably foster acceptance, trust, and safety for vehicle occupants. This update offers insights into our current progress and findings.
### Human-centered and explainable AI in focus
**How can we make autonomous driving understandable and accessible for everyone?** That is the central question for us in the STADT:up project. In Subproject 2 – “Human Factors”, Ergosign focuses on developing information and interaction concepts that explain the behavior of autonomous vehicles. Only when we understand what’s happening around us and how the vehicle is making decisions can we feel truly safe. Human-centered user experience design is crucial here: solutions must be aligned with people’s needs to unlock their full potential.
#### Adaptive and modular interaction concepts
To build trust in AI-based systems like autonomous vehicles, we need to demonstrate how they make decisions. We are experimenting with various ways and modalities to communicate AI decisions — via displays, audio signals, or ambient lighting. It’s important that the information is helpful without being overwhelming. We’re aiming for the perfect information balance and exploring situation- and context-dependent interaction modules.
#### Simulator studies provide key insights
We rigorously test our ideas and concepts through user studies and simulation environments. Some of our key findings so far include:
  * **Information needs:** The occupants’ need for information strongly depends on how safe or dangerous the driving situation feels.
  * **Critical moments:** In critical situations, many occupants find it important to know exactly what the vehicle sees and plans. A clear and understandable visualization of the surroundings is very valuable here.
  * **Multimodal signals:** Multimodal signals can optimize the user experience but require careful design to avoid overwhelming or irritating the users. Light and sound cues can enhance UX and build trust in autonomous vehicles if used purposefully.

#### Augmented Reality: Looking ahead 
To improve information delivery, we’re currently exploring the potential of Augmented Reality (AR). With AR, we can project cues and information directly into the user’s field of vision, such as onto the windshield. In summer 2025, we plan to conduct further user studies in Munich and Hamburg to explore this in more detail. Want to take part and help shape the future of mobility? Sign up for our study [here](https://www.ergosign.de/de/newsletter/anmelden).
#### EngineeringUI: The cockpit for developers
In addition to the UX for passengers, we are also developing an EngineeringUI for developers of AI software in Subproject 5 – “Autonomous Driving.” As mentioned in our first article on STADT:up, we initially analyzed the usage context with our partners, derived requirements, and translated them into personas. Based on this foundation, we identified opportunity areas where the EngineeringUI can support developers in their work.
STADT:up Entwickler-Persona “Eggart Engineer”.
The EngineeringUI visualizes vehicle sensor data in a web application and is optimized for mobile use in and around test vehicles. It helps developers record, annotate, and manage data and evaluate and optimize algorithms.
For development, we use the Robot Operating System (ROS) as a foundation — a flexible, open-source framework that handles core robot communication and control. To visualize and analyze the ROS-generated data streams in real-time, we use the open source application Foxglove, also adopted at the start of the project. We have specifically optimized Foxglove for mobile use on tablets and other portable devices and expanded its visualization capabilities with integrated recording and annotation functions that let us mark and log critical events during operation.
In the long term, the UI aims to enable high-performance sensor data visualization and real-time adjustment of visualization or HMI settings. A major challenge is the sheer volume of data transmitted and processed by the test vehicles. To tackle this, we’re working closely with our project partners.

#### On the home stretch
The STADT:up project is heading into its final phase and will conclude in spring 2026. Thanks to collaboration with OEM, suppliers, and research institutions, we’re developing practical, scientifically grounded solutions for understandable autonomous systems. We’re also supporting the next generation of technical and scientific talent and creating valuable synergies between human factors research and technology development. The empirical findings will flow directly into the development of human-centered, understandable, and trustworthy autonomous vehicles.
Through this and many other projects, Ergosign is applying its expertise to shape the mobility of tomorrow. We look forward to sharing more insights and results from STADT:up’s final project year soon!

Philipp Shardt
19/01/2022 • 9 minutes reading time
In the land of web development, there are countless ways to build user interfaces. With lots of frameworks and libraries containing every feature possible. But they all have one thing in common - they build on components. The best-known frameworks are React, Angular and Vue. These are used in the majority of projects, even at Ergosign.
A user interface must work without error while being visually appealing and intuitive to use. A challenge that design and development must solve together. The design must be developed consistently throughout the application.
In web development, this is best achieved by using UI components. So that each component is used “cleanly”, the focus is primarily on the properties of encapsulation regarding individual functions and simplified testing. Alongside functional unit tests, manual design reviews, mobile responsiveness tests and accessibility (a11y) tests are also required. In Storybook, we have found an open source tool that lets us build UI components more quickly and efficiently than ever before - thanks to our very own add-on.
#### Storybook: fairytale UI components
No, we’re not telling tall tales. If you’ve never heard of Storybook, you can read the following description on the 
> „Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.“
We have to agree. Storybook offers plenty of benefits for us, such as:
  * Isolated development of components regardless of later application.
  * Documentation of use cases in simple JavaScript. This makes for easier development, testing and checking in quality assurance.
  * An overview of all components in a live gallery with related documentation.
  * Simple (manual) visual testing of components in various browsers.
  * And the cherry on top: Storybook supports all modern frameworks.


A wish come true for easier, more efficient development and better quality assurance with Storybook. Why are we so enamored, and how did we come up with the idea for our Storybook add-on? To answer that, we have to look to the past. How did we build UI components before?
#### Once upon a time, there was… UX Library
Before using Storybook, we worked with a similar tool that we had developed ourselves. UX Library offered an overview of all project components in an isolated environment.
Here, all components can be seen in their various versions and pseudo-states (such as hover, active, focus). So Design and Development can see all the necessary information at a glance. But UX Library has some limitations compared to Storybook.
Not all frameworks used at Ergosign were supported. Maintaining the library and regularly updating the relevant frameworks was very time-consuming. Edge cases, so stories with complex examples, were difficult to create. When styling pseudo-states, these had to be manually added to prevent artefacts in the build-output.
#### A quest to technical lands
Storybook offers good solutions for the problems encountered when using UX Library. But there is no opportunity to display the various pseudo-states and characteristics at the same time.
You have to click a button to see these in their active state. The only way to force the element into styling the pseudo-state is to define and apply it normally.
This requires two steps:
Step 1: 
Step 2: 
Step 1 in more detail: Automatic generation of pseudo-styling
Thankfully, a plug-in for PostCSS („A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript“) has already been developed that allows the automatic generation of CSS classes from the pseudo-state styling in CSS files. It can also be found as an open sourceproject on Github and furnished with additional functions by using pull requests. We also offer additional presets that automatically adjust the configuration with Storybook and Webpack. These integrate and configure the plugin in the PostCSS loader. The other classes are only created in Storybook and the final build output in live systems is spared from unwanted artefacts.
Step 2 in more detail: Applying pseudo-styling
In the next step, the various states have to be displayed. In the story, you define which pseudo-states should be shown. In addition, further attributes and/or framework-specific properties can be filled with values that are also applied to the relevant components (code example of story definition).
The component is rendered multiple times in Storybook Canvas and the relevant generated pseudo-state class is used.
#### The idea for an add-on is born
Our Storybook add-on closes this gap. Both steps are automated by the add-on. All pseudo-state styling for the component is automatically translated into real CSS classes, and the story definition lets you easily define which states are even presented. A real improvement!
An insight to the add-on:

```

Shared with the community
At Ergosign, we have one Friday a month to tackle a (UX) topic of our choice - this is called Focus Time. The add-on was one of these. The required features were implemented with an additional time budget. And it was a success! The add-on is available as an
The community seems impressed and has been generous with their stars. Our Storybook add-on has now been used in countless projects.
The conclusion is always: very valuable for web development work. The development process has been simplified and sped up, and many cases are covered. One of the greatest benefits is the efficient collaboration between design and development teams in manual design reviews.
We will continue to develop the add-on as an open-source tool. All issues (error notifications) are logged and processed in our ticket system. Thanks to the community, we have support not only from lots of Ergosign colleagues but also externally.
…and when you open Storybook, you can use the add-on happily ever after.

Thankfully, a plug-in for PostCSS („A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript“) has already been developed that allows the automatic generation of CSS classes from the pseudo-state styling in CSS files. It can also be found as an open sourceproject on Github and furnished with additional functions by using pull requests. We also offer additional presets that automatically adjust the configuration with Storybook and Webpack. These integrate and configure the plugin in the PostCSS loader. The other classes are only created in Storybook and the final build output in live systems is spared from unwanted artefacts.
Step 2 in more detail: Applying pseudo-styling
In the next step, the various states have to be displayed. In the story, you define which pseudo-states should be shown. In addition, further attributes and/or framework-specific properties can be filled with values that are also applied to the relevant components (code example of story definition).
The component is rendered multiple times in Storybook Canvas and the relevant generated pseudo-state class is used.
#### The idea for an add-on is born
Our Storybook add-on closes this gap. Both steps are automated by the add-on. All pseudo-state styling for the component is automatically translated into real CSS classes, and the story definition lets you easily define which states are even presented. A real improvement!
An insight to the add-on:

In the land of web development, there are countless ways to build user interfaces. With lots of frameworks and libraries containing every feature possible. But they all have one thing in common - they build on components. The best-known frameworks are React, Angular and Vue. These are used in the majority of projects, even at Ergosign.
A user interface must work without error while being visually appealing and intuitive to use. A challenge that design and development must solve together. The design must be developed consistently throughout the application.
In web development, this is best achieved by using UI components. So that each component is used “cleanly”, the focus is primarily on the properties of encapsulation regarding individual functions and simplified testing. Alongside functional unit tests, manual design reviews, mobile responsiveness tests and accessibility (a11y) tests are also required. In Storybook, we have found an open source tool that lets us build UI components more quickly and efficiently than ever before - thanks to our very own add-on.
#### Storybook: fairytale UI components
No, we’re not telling tall tales. If you’ve never heard of Storybook, you can read the following description on the 
> „Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.“
We have to agree. Storybook offers plenty of benefits for us, such as:
  * Isolated development of components regardless of later application.
  * Documentation of use cases in simple JavaScript. This makes for easier development, testing and checking in quality assurance.
  * An overview of all components in a live gallery with related documentation.
  * Simple (manual) visual testing of components in various browsers.
  * And the cherry on top: Storybook supports all modern frameworks.


A wish come true for easier, more efficient development and better quality assurance with Storybook. Why are we so enamored, and how did we come up with the idea for our Storybook add-on? To answer that, we have to look to the past. How did we build UI components before?
#### Once upon a time, there was… UX Library
Before using Storybook, we worked with a similar tool that we had developed ourselves. UX Library offered an overview of all project components in an isolated environment.
Here, all components can be seen in their various versions and pseudo-states (such as hover, active, focus). So Design and Development can see all the necessary information at a glance. But UX Library has some limitations compared to Storybook.
Not all frameworks used at Ergosign were supported. Maintaining the library and regularly updating the relevant frameworks was very time-consuming. Edge cases, so stories with complex examples, were difficult to create. When styling pseudo-states, these had to be manually added to prevent artefacts in the build-output.
#### A quest to technical lands
Storybook offers good solutions for the problems encountered when using UX Library. But there is no opportunity to display the various pseudo-states and characteristics at the same time.
You have to click a button to see these in their active state. The only way to force the element into styling the pseudo-state is to define and apply it normally.
This requires two steps:

_This is the third part of our content series on everything that is involved in migrating content to a headless CMS. After discussing the benefits of switching to a headless CMS and the basic requirements for a successful migration in the_[ _first article_](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/swd-headless-cms/) _of our content series, we delved deeper into the actual migration process and the success factors for a hybrid content migration in the s_[ _econd part_](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/swd-hybride-migration/) _. In this third part, we would like to introduce another important aspect of the project: the targeted support of employees throughout the entire migration process._
A technological transformation such as the CMS migration at Stadtwerke Düsseldorf not only presents a technical challenge but also means a lasting transformation for everyone involved. To make this transformation successful, our designers developed an employee campaign based on four central pillars: 
  * clearly introducing the new CMS, Storyblok,
  * explaining the purpose and goals behind the migration,
  * actively gathering feedback from employees, and
  * bringing it all to life in a playful way through gamification.


#### A playful approach with a memo game at its heart
The awareness campaign centered on a specially developed memo game that addressed key terms such as ""Digital Experience Platform (DXP),"" ""migration,"" and ""CMS."" 
Unlike a classic memory game, this one doesn't involve matching pairs of cards, but rather (project-specific) key terms and their explanations. The goal was to familiarize employees with the basics of the new digital strategy in a playful way. Additionally, it would encourage discussion about the migration and the new CMS. We also designed posters, flyers, and table displays to make the campaign visible in key locations and to increase awareness within the company.
DXP memo game
#### Making the benefits of the new CMS tangible
The campaign clearly communicated the key benefits of the migration:
  * **Single source of truth** : Content can be maintained centrally and rolled out across multiple touchpoints.
  * **Democratization** : Storyblok enables all employees to maintain content independently – for greater efficiency and collaborative work.


Tobias Zapp, Head of DXP at Ergosign, sums it up aptly: ""The goal of the DXP project was to enable more people to participate through better technology.""
Marie-Claire Harnasch, Lead UX Designer on the DXP project, adds: ""Our campaign made the digital topics surrounding the DXP project tangible and encouraged employees to actively contribute their expertise to the development of the digital platform.""
Boosting digital knowledge through play – here with the term “SEO” in the DXP memo game.
#### Enablement through continuous development
The campaign evolved from a purely informational initiative to an enablement campaign: explaining the benefits of migration and, through the memory game, creating a playful way to internalize key terms and concepts. In the future, the memory game can be expanded to include topics such as UX, accessibility, and UI – an approach designed to promote continuous learning and development within the company.
#### Our approach: Being a creative partner for change and people
The campaign exemplifies one of our guiding principles: We see ourselves not just as a service provider, but as a partner who supports companies and employees on their journey. With well-thought-out, creative concepts, we create solutions that unite technical excellence with user-centered thinking, – because real change begins with people.

The future for marketers is ""headless"" - at least when it comes to building a Digital Experience Platform (DXP). Choosing a suitable headless Content Management System (CMS) is the foundation for any DXP. A digital structure like this allows businesses to create seamless and personalized experiences across various digital channels, such as mobile apps, websites, or social media. As part of a content series, we showcase what matters in a successful website migration, using the example of our loyal client Stadtwerke Düsseldorf.
In the first part of the series, we focus on why transitioning to a headless CMS is worthwhile and which aspects are crucial for a successful content migration.
Ergosign has been designing digital services with outstanding customer experience for Stadtwerke Düsseldorf for several years (read more about the successful collaboration here). Currently, our team is working on expanding the web platform into a DXP to ensure a personalized customer experience across all digital touchpoints. This involves the migration to a new CMS.
#### Digression: Not all CMS’ are equal
A Content Management System serves creating and managing digital content (in text, image, video, or other forms). There are different types of CMS:
The traditional CMS
A state-of-the-art headless CMS
Traditional vs. headless CMS
#### Transform your brand with a Digital Experience Platform: Discover how Stadtwerke Düsseldorf took the leap.
#### Why headless? Benefits at a glance
>   * Omni-channel presence and unified brand experience
>   * Flexibility and scalability
>   * Time savings and increased productivity
>   * Improved website performance
>   * Technological independence
>   * Faster time-to-market
> 

Stadtwerke Düsseldorf opted to switch from a monolithic CMS to a headless CMS. The separation of front and back end in the headless CMS offers numerous advantages for the online marketing team, sales, and customer service:
By storing content in a neutral format and making it available through an API, it can be managed centrally for various platforms, devices, technologies, as well as iOS and Android apps – ensuring seamless omni-channel presence with a unified brand experience! At Stadtwerke, content for both the website and app can now be maintained in a single CMS, providing more flexibility and scalability, saving time, and thus increasing the productivity of editors. All these advantages also positively impact the time-to-market. In addition to an improved usability, a headless CMS offers a compelling website performance, which can positively affect SEO rankings.
Stadtwerke Düsseldorf chose Storyblok as their headless CMS. This CMS stands out, especially with its high usability and a visual editor that makes back end editing faster and more intuitive. Senior Software Engineer Maximilian Stolz is also convinced: ""With Storyblok, we are not tied to a specific technology stack (tech stack). Thanks to the flexibility of the CMS, we can tailor a tech stack to the needs of our customers. This results in truly bespoke DXPs, leading to an improved experience for customers, as well as editors and employees.“
If Storyblok doesn't meet your requirements, we will guide you through the decision-making process and are open to other providers.
#### Pre-migration: New tech stack, defined responsibilities, and content audit
Before migration, it's essential to define the new tech stack. Since Storyblok offers various framework options, we decided for a framework already familiar to Stadtwerke Düsseldorf: React.
Migrating to a new CMS always is a great opportunity to audit content: identifying outdated content, revising existing content, or SEO optimization. The decisions on which content to migrate are crucial in this process and should not be underestimated.
Stadtwerke Düsseldorf took this opportunity to analyze their existing content. Due to their extensive website with diverse content on topics such as electricity, water, gas, heating, and warmth, we decided against a fully automated migration.
Instead, content is migrated gradually. To maintain a clear overview of the migration, we started by defining responsibilities and created an outline of the various migrating content areas. This helped us visualize manageable work packages with intermediate steps and review processes in a dashboard for the migration team, keeping track of the progress at all times.
#### Advantages of manual content migration
A success factor in the migration project of Stadtwerke Düsseldorf was breaking down the content into smaller, manageable packages. The benefits of this approach are evident: Gradual migration allows for adapting and optimizing content during the migration and conserving resources in the team. Simultaneously, it enables tracking the migration's progress and responding flexibly to potential challenges.
#### Best practices for a successful migration
Uncertainties and perhaps even fears of a large migration are entirely normal and understandable. To alleviate all concerns about a manual migration within the Stadtwerke Düsseldorf team, we provided both training (on-site and online) and continuous support. Thus we ensured that the team felt supported throughout the migration process, and that they possessed the necessary skills and knowledge to migrate the content successfully. Naturally, we not only provided training and advice, but we also actively assisted in content migration when needed.
#### Pre-migration checklist: Requirements for a successful migration preparation?
  1. Choosing a new headless CMS: Be aware of your CMS requirements and choose the appropriate CMS based on these criteria. We are happy to guide you through the decision-making process!
  2. Select the new tech stack: Collaborate with developers to create a list of criteria and features that you want to be implemented. Choose a tech stack that fits your requirements.
  3. Define responsibilities: Define the roles and responsibilities of all involved parties before migration. Establishing goals and deadlines help control the migration's success.
  4. Analyze in a content audit which content should be migrated. Analyze and evaluate existing content based on performance, relevance, quality etc.  
Determine which content should be migrated and, if necessary, adapted or optimized.

All these advantages also positively impact the time-to-market. In addition to an improved usability, a headless CMS offers a compelling website performance, which can positively affect SEO rankings.
Stadtwerke Düsseldorf chose Storyblok as their headless CMS. This CMS stands out, especially with its high usability and a visual editor that makes back end editing faster and more intuitive. Senior Software Engineer Maximilian Stolz is also convinced: ""With Storyblok, we are not tied to a specific technology stack (tech stack). Thanks to the flexibility of the CMS, we can tailor a tech stack to the needs of our customers. This results in truly bespoke DXPs, leading to an improved experience for customers, as well as editors and employees.“
If Storyblok doesn't meet your requirements, we will guide you through the decision-making process and are open to other providers.
#### Pre-migration: New tech stack, defined responsibilities, and content audit
Before migration, it's essential to define the new tech stack. Since Storyblok offers various framework options, we decided for a framework already familiar to Stadtwerke Düsseldorf: React.
Migrating to a new CMS always is a great opportunity to audit content: identifying outdated content, revising existing content, or SEO optimization. The decisions on which content to migrate are crucial in this process and should not be underestimated.
Stadtwerke Düsseldorf took this opportunity to analyze their existing content. Due to their extensive website with diverse content on topics such as electricity, water, gas, heating, and warmth, we decided against a fully automated migration.
Instead, content is migrated gradually. To maintain a clear overview of the migration, we started by defining responsibilities and created an outline of the various migrating content areas. This helped us visualize manageable work packages with intermediate steps and review processes in a dashboard for the migration team, keeping track of the progress at all times.
#### Advantages of manual content migration
A success factor in the migration project of Stadtwerke Düsseldorf was breaking down the content into smaller, manageable packages. The benefits of this approach are evident: Gradual migration allows for adapting and optimizing content during the migration and conserving resources in the team. Simultaneously, it enables tracking the migration's progress and responding flexibly to potential challenges.
#### Best practices for a successful migration
Uncertainties and perhaps even fears of a large migration are entirely normal and understandable. To alleviate all concerns about a manual migration within the Stadtwerke Düsseldorf team, we provided both training (on-site and online) and continuous support. Thus we ensured that the team felt supported throughout the migration process, and that they possessed the necessary skills and knowledge to migrate the content successfully. Naturally, we not only provided training and advice, but we also actively assisted in content migration when needed.
#### Pre-migration checklist: Requirements for a successful migration preparation?
  1. Choosing a new headless CMS: Be aware of your CMS requirements and choose the appropriate CMS based on these criteria. We are happy to guide you through the decision-making process!
  2. Select the new tech stack: Collaborate with developers to create a list of criteria and features that you want to be implemented. Choose a tech stack that fits your requirements.
  3. Define responsibilities: Define the roles and responsibilities of all involved parties before migration. Establishing goals and deadlines help control the migration's success.
  4. Analyze in a content audit which content should be migrated. Analyze and evaluate existing content based on performance, relevance, quality etc.  
Determine which content should be migrated and, if necessary, adapted or optimized.

In the [first part of our content series](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/swd-headless-cms/), we dove into the basics of a successful content migration from a traditional monolithic to a headless CMS with the Stadtwerke Düsseldorf example.
The migration of content to a headless CMS is a crucial step towards a digital experience platform (DXP). But how do you proceed when the existing system comprises several hundred content pages, of which the majority needs to be migrated to the new system?
Our loyal client, Stadtwerke Düsseldorf, also faced this question. In the second part of this content series, we dive deeper into the migration process using the example of their online magazine.
#### Automated vs. manual migration
Initially, we weighed the pros and cons of automated and manual migration. The biggest advantage of automated migration
On the other hand, manual migration
#### The best of both worlds – hybrid migration of the online magazine
Since we migrated numerous pages with varying requirements for Stadtwerke Düsseldorf, we opted for a combination of automated and manual migration. The hybrid approach combines the respective advantages: where appropriate, less complex content, which varies little, is migrated automatically. This saves time, which can be used to manually transfer and optimize complex content.
We started with the migration of the online magazine of Stadtwerke Düsseldorf. Every month, the magazine provides customers with exciting articles on local pride, life, innovation, leisure, mobility, work, and much more. With nearly 500 content pages and a variety of different and nested components such as text, headline, image, and video, the magazine posed a challenge for hybrid migration. We initially developed a new frontend concept that considers SEO recommendations, and prototyped it in Figma. Naturally, we also took into account the requirements of digital accessibility for Stadtwerke Düsseldorf's magazine.
Digital accessibility for an optimal customer experience was considered from the beginning and throughout the remaining content migration.
After developing the components, we began with the automated migration, transferring the framework of the magazine: structures, page titles, and metadata. The Stadtwerke Düsseldorf team was trained by us in using the CMS Storyblok, followed by manual content migration. Our team at Ergosign also actively assisted, if support was needed. This way, the entire online magazine could be transferred efficiently to the new CMS and was simultaneously optimized.

#### Continuous support and quality assurance
A successful content migration requires not only careful planning and implementation, but also continuous support and quality assurance. Before and during the migration, we conducted training sessions for the Stadtwerke Düsseldorf team and ensured that the team was familiar with the new CMS. The transition to Storyblok was made easy due to its high usability and intuitive editing in the backend, especially through the visual editor. After the migration, we tested the migrated articles for errors and set up URL redirects where necessary to ensure a smooth customer experience.
#### Checklist: Success factors for successful hybrid content migration
  1. Careful planning:   
Thorough analysis and planning are crucial to understanding the scope of the migration, identifying potential challenges, and establishing a clear timeline.
  2. Evaluation of automated and manual migration:   
A precise assessment of the pros and cons of automated and manual migration enables finding the right balance between efficiency and control.
  3. Development of a new frontend concept:   
Developing a new frontend concept that considers the requirements of the new CMS and SEO recommendations lays the foundation for successful migration and content optimization.
  4. Training and support for the team:   
Comprehensive training of the team in using the new CMS is essential to ensure that all stakeholders are familiar with the new tools and processes.
  5. Continuous support and quality assurance:   
Ongoing support during the migration process and thorough quality assurance ensure that potential issues are quickly identified and resolved to ensure a smooth customer experience.
  6. Usability of the new CMS:   
Choosing a CMS with high usability and intuitive operation facilitates the transition for the team and helps increase the efficiency of the migration.
  7. Testing and troubleshooting:   
Testing the migrated content for errors and setting up URL redirects are crucial in ensuring customers receive a consistent and error-free user experience.
  8. Clear communication and collaboration:   
Open communication and effective collaboration among all stakeholders are crucial for the success of the migration.


At Ergosign, we believe that no content migration is like any other. Therefore, we approach each project tailored to the customer.

Jan Groenefeld
03/12/2020 • 6 minutes reading time
In the first part of our article on the Paexo exoskeleton, our Solution Manager Industry Jan Groenefeld tells us about his visit to Ottobock and what he learned about “human mobility”. Missed this article? Then [check it out here](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/future-human-mobility)!
Why are we — as a digital agency focusing on user experience — even interested in things like this?The answer is simple: innovation and curiosity are part of our DNA. Ergosign also sees itself as an active driver of digital transformation. In order to provide our clients from various industries with meaningful advice, it’s essential to broaden our own horizons. Even if technology doesn’t seem to have anything at all to do with user interfaces in the strictest sense at first glance.
This is the case with Ottobock exoskeletons.
A key moment was the realization that Ergosign and Ottobock are linked by a common mission: human-centered design through the responsible and sustainable use of present and future technology. For a world where technology actively supports people instead of overwhelming them.
We’ve summarized Jan Gronefeld’s insightful interview with Samuel Reimer (Business Development at Ottobock) for you:
#### Exo-What? Active, Passive, Smart.
Jan: “Trying things out in the Experience World was impressive. All of my colleagues said the same thing, ‘I want to give that a go!’”
Samuel
The key to success is not necessarily in producing highly complex and technically flamboyant cyborgs to give us superhuman powers. The greatest value even today is offered by wearable assistance systems that significantly reduce the physical burden in production, assembly, logistics and many other physically intense professions.
> This way of connecting people with technology can help humanity. And it should!
The keyword is ergonomics — where the automation of workplaces reaches its limit, exoskeletons provide a crucial solution for many people.”
Jan“Before we get too deep, can you please explain the technical background?”
Samuel  
Exoskeletons, on the other hand, are incredibly flexible. In principle, they’re orthotics worn directly on the body to support people, or certain extremities, in specific situations.”
Jan“You call these systems Wearable Human Bionics at Ottobock, right?”
Samuel
Jan“In my research on exoskeletons, I’ve come across two different types - active and passive.”
Samuel
Jan“Of course - the extra weight comes from all the necessary batteries, electronics and actuators. And the sensors have to react in real time…”
Samuel
Even though we already have a great deal of know-how internally — just look at the highly innovative, active C-leg from Ottobock — we take a rather “conservative” approach, unlike some of our competitors. But we center our focus on actual customer needs. Alongside protecting the body, these are maximum support at the lowest possible weight, no restriction of movement, subtle design and, last but not least, easy usability.”

**Jan** : “That sounds understandable. What’s irritating me is the lack of connection. Smart factories gain life from the constant exchange of data between different parties Your exoskeletons don’t seem very communicative?”
> Our Paexos are becoming smart. The key here is active communication in the IoT environment.
SamuelThrough our very close customer interaction and regular communication with end users, user needs are transparent and accessible for us
**Jan** : “That’s what I wanted to hear.” (laughs)
Samuel
> “If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it!”
Jan: “Data collected by sensors must be an important key in the further development of your Paexos. Active communication with the IoT world opens up a completely new dimension of product ideas and business models, right?”
Samuel
#### User Acceptance - Humans Take Center Stage
Jan: “Let’s stay on the topic of user acceptance. What have you done up to now to ensure the system is intuitive? To make sure the user has fun and trusts your products?”
Samuel
> In heavy industry, at home or at work: successful products have a mission. They solve problems, create added value, evoke emotions. To achieve this, all production steps follow a purposeful strategy.
> It’s the same in our projects. Curious? Our strategy page provides a compact overview of our services. [_Find out more here!_](https://www.ergosign.de/en/services/overview.html)
Jan: “Actually, your approach mostly complies with the Usability Engineering process under ISO 9241 and agile process models. That’s definitely the right path. What else?”
Samuel
Jan: “Both aspects have been solved really well in the Paexo Shoulder in my opinion, and the supportive effect is remarkable. The Paexo Back is also a great assistance system. At the same time, it feels considerably more solid. In our experience, rejection or enthusiasm often arise in the first few moments of use.
At this point, a digital guide could actively dissipate any reservations. After all, not everyone has a Samuel at their side to explain things.”
Samuel
> Health and safety officers are probably quite rightly asking: What does it do to the body?
Jan: “Acceptance is created through explanation. And Ottobock is doing quite a lot in this area.”
Samuel
As part of our PR work, we’ve founded multiple virtual fairs - ExoDay and ExoMeet - with representatives from health and safety, industrial businesses and end users. We’re also investing lots of energy into effectiveness, simulation and long-term studies to document the effectiveness of our products and to use this for developing the market further.
In my experience, subjective acceptance is the be all and end all
#### Future & Summary
Jan: “We are slowly reaching the home stretch of our interview. What would you like to leave our readers with?”
SamuelPeople are the key
Connection is important in order to take part in the digitization cosmos as an active member. Mechanically speaking, our Paexos are already State of the Art
Data and visualizations that get across what exactly the exoskeleton is doing are an important piece of the puzzle for Paexo-Vision. Our next step will be to visualize the powers and burdens at workplaces. To this end, we need the sensors we talked about at the beginning.”
Jan: “You must know the saying: technology is a reflection of society? Do you have an ethical code that you follow?”
Samuel
We’ve achieved a lot in a short time. And the community is completely behind our ergonomic solutions. But we still have some things left on our list. It shouldn’t be boring either. Being able to ride this first wave of a technical revolution is great. It's simply an incredible feeling.”
Jan: “A great closing sentence. Samuel - thank you for a lovely chat and exciting insights.”

Even if technology doesn’t seem to have anything at all to do with user interfaces in the strictest sense at first glance.
This is the case with Ottobock exoskeletons.
A key moment was the realization that Ergosign and Ottobock are linked by a common mission: human-centered design through the responsible and sustainable use of present and future technology. For a world where technology actively supports people instead of overwhelming them.
We’ve summarized Jan Gronefeld’s insightful interview with Samuel Reimer (Business Development at Ottobock) for you:
#### Exo-What? Active, Passive, Smart.
Jan: “Trying things out in the Experience World was impressive. All of my colleagues said the same thing, ‘I want to give that a go!’”
Samuel
The key to success is not necessarily in producing highly complex and technically flamboyant cyborgs to give us superhuman powers. The greatest value even today is offered by wearable assistance systems that significantly reduce the physical burden in production, assembly, logistics and many other physically intense professions.
> This way of connecting people with technology can help humanity. And it should!
The keyword is ergonomics — where the automation of workplaces reaches its limit, exoskeletons provide a crucial solution for many people.”
Jan“Before we get too deep, can you please explain the technical background?”
Samuel  
Exoskeletons, on the other hand, are incredibly flexible. In principle, they’re orthotics worn directly on the body to support people, or certain extremities, in specific situations.”
Jan“You call these systems Wearable Human Bionics at Ottobock, right?”
Samuel
Jan“In my research on exoskeletons, I’ve come across two different types - active and passive.”
Samuel
Jan“Of course - the extra weight comes from all the necessary batteries, electronics and actuators. And the sensors have to react in real time…”
Samuel
Even though we already have a great deal of know-how internally — just look at the highly innovative, active C-leg from Ottobock — we take a rather “conservative” approach, unlike some of our competitors. But we center our focus on actual customer needs. Alongside protecting the body, these are maximum support at the lowest possible weight, no restriction of movement, subtle design and, last but not least, easy usability.”

**Jan** : “That sounds understandable. What’s irritating me is the lack of connection. Smart factories gain life from the constant exchange of data between different parties Your exoskeletons don’t seem very communicative?”
> Our Paexos are becoming smart. The key here is active communication in the IoT environment.
SamuelThrough our very close customer interaction and regular communication with end users, user needs are transparent and accessible for us
**Jan** : “That’s what I wanted to hear.” (laughs)
Samuel
> “If you cannot measure it, you cannot manage it!”
Jan: “Data collected by sensors must be an important key in the further development of your Paexos. Active communication with the IoT world opens up a completely new dimension of product ideas and business models, right?”
Samuel
#### User Acceptance - Humans Take Center Stage
Jan: “Let’s stay on the topic of user acceptance. What have you done up to now to ensure the system is intuitive? To make sure the user has fun and trusts your products?”
Samuel
> In heavy industry, at home or at work: successful products have a mission. They solve problems, create added value, evoke emotions. To achieve this, all production steps follow a purposeful strategy.
> It’s the same in our projects. Curious? Our strategy page provides a compact overview of our services. [_Find out more here!_](https://www.ergosign.de/en/services/overview.html)
Jan: “Actually, your approach mostly complies with the Usability Engineering process under ISO 9241 and agile process models. That’s definitely the right path. What else?”
Samuel
Jan: “Both aspects have been solved really well in the Paexo Shoulder in my opinion, and the supportive effect is remarkable. The Paexo Back is also a great assistance system. At the same time, it feels considerably more solid. In our experience, rejection or enthusiasm often arise in the first few moments of use.
At this point, a digital guide could actively dissipate any reservations. After all, not everyone has a Samuel at their side to explain things.”
Samuel
> Health and safety officers are probably quite rightly asking: What does it do to the body?
Jan: “Acceptance is created through explanation. And Ottobock is doing quite a lot in this area.”
Samuel
As part of our PR work, we’ve founded multiple virtual fairs - ExoDay and ExoMeet - with representatives from health and safety, industrial businesses and end users. We’re also investing lots of energy into effectiveness, simulation and long-term studies to document the effectiveness of our products and to use this for developing the market further.
In my experience, subjective acceptance is the be all and end all
#### Future & Summary
Jan: “We are slowly reaching the home stretch of our interview. What would you like to leave our readers with?”
SamuelPeople are the key
Connection is important in order to take part in the digitization cosmos as an active member. Mechanically speaking, our Paexos are already State of the Art
Data and visualizations that get across what exactly the exoskeleton is doing are an important piece of the puzzle for Paexo-Vision. Our next step will be to visualize the powers and burdens at workplaces. To this end, we need the sensors we talked about at the beginning.”
Jan: “You must know the saying: technology is a reflection of society? Do you have an ethical code that you follow?”
Samuel
We’ve achieved a lot in a short time. And the community is completely behind our ergonomic solutions. But we still have some things left on our list. It shouldn’t be boring either. Being able to ride this first wave of a technical revolution is great. It's simply an incredible feeling.”
Jan: “A great closing sentence. Samuel - thank you for a lovely chat and exciting insights.”

### Security by Design: Another milestone in the field of information security
We are proud to announce that Ergosign has achieved the highest TISAX® standard (Level 3) certification in February 2024. This marks a significant milestone in our commitment to meeting the highest requirements in information security and underscores our steadfast dedication to our stakeholders' needs. 
#### What is TISAX about?
TISAX® stands for ""Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange"" and is a security standard specifically developed for the automotive industry. It is based on several national and international standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001, VDA ISA, and BSI Grundschutz. Its aim is to ensure a trusted exchange of sensitive information and data between businesses in the automotive sector. Ergosign has been TISAX® certified since 2021.
Information security is a complex issue, often perceived as purely a technical challenge. However, the human component plays a central role. Only when people understand and support security concepts can these be implemented successfully. Information security extends far beyond technical measures in IT security. There are many topics and potential impacts on corporate culture that must be considered for an integrated and successful implementation. Besides employee awareness and building security, there must be several risk and business continuity plans established, continuously developed, and reviewed regularly. 
Through a human-centered and systemic approach, we ensure that all measures taken are not only effective but also user-friendly. Ultimately, it is people who interact with us and our services. Their trust, as well as their own security awareness, is crucial.
> The certification symbolizes our commitment and the expertise of our entire team, which has tirelessly worked to continuously optimize our systems and processes to the highest standards. Certification does not mean stagnation, but rather a motivation to consistently pursue this path and adapt to the constantly changing challenges in the field of information security — towards a secure and resilient company.
Katharina Roos
Through the development of our information security management system, we have been able to further optimize internal processes, leading to a more efficient and effective way of working, from which all stakeholders, especially our customers and employees, benefit.
We have created a framework through our integrated management system that allows our employees to focus on the essentials and use their creativity in the best interest of our customers. Because innovation and information security are by no means mutually exclusive. On the contrary, a strong security culture can even foster innovation by creating an environment where creative ideas can be freely exchanged and developed without neglecting security.
> This significant goal was achieved through the extraordinary dedication and expertise of our interdisciplinary team, whose efforts were crucial and reflect our continuous pursuit of quality and security.
Swen Lux
By incorporating security concerns into our design and development processes from the outset, we can create innovative solutions that are both secure and user friendly. Overall, the re-certification according to stricter criteria represents another important and logical step for Ergosign, emphasizing our commitment to the highest security standards in a disruptive world.  
  
The results of our certification are available on the official TISAX portal for registered members: : 
• Scope-ID: S8HT6T
• Assessment-ID: AC7793-1
• Participant-ID: PKH3LH

### What do Wallace & Gromit have to do with design?
It has been fascinating to see how trends from the past have established themselves and, in some cases, become the norm throughout 2022. So we have looked at current trends and possible new standards for 2023.  
  
A trend that has definitely established itself is New Brutalism — also part of anti-design. There, the beauty of function trumps the beauty of form, and the style impresses with raw aesthetics, harsh contrasts, striking typography, and the absence of gradients.
#### From trend to standard
A trend that has become more of a standard is dark mode, which many users now prefer. One thing that, in our opinion, should absolutely become a standard is diversity in design. By this, we mean the most diverse possible representation of people of different ages, nationalities, gender identities and sexual orientations, physical and mental abilities, religions, etc.  
  
Our report also looks at trends like Claymorphism, Retro and Memphis Design, Vivid Minimalism, and a few others. If you want to read our report in detail and understand the reference to the famous characters Wallace & Gromit, you can download it here.

Esther Barra

To ensure perfect video content management via Storyblok's CMS, we have developed a tailor-made video encoder plug-in, which we would like to introduce in more detail in this insights article._  
_
#### How did the plug-in come about?
Video content is becoming increasingly important for digital presences as it simplifies processing of information for users and increases retention time. However, video content poses a challenge not only for content creation, but also for website content management. Not all formats and codecs are suitable for online use, and very few browsers are compatible with all codecs. Additionally, the quality and size of the file must be perfectly balanced. Large files lead to long loading times, which can have a negative impact on the user experience and Google ranking. Optimal viewing across different devices, screen sizes and data transfer rates also requires special attention.
The right choice of CMS can be crucial here. In order to create a DXP that is tailored precisely to the customer needs, Ergosign uses various state-of-the-art technologies. This also includes several content management systems, such as Storyblok. This CMS impresses with an excellent editor experience and offers our customers numerous advantages, this includes the fact that content management for images and graphics was appreciated. However, we have found that, as with most CMS, content management and video encoding still has room for improvement. However, Storyblok's asset management for images and graphics is great, which is why we didn't opt for integrating with an external app with an all-in-one approach.
Instead, we have developed a plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into Storyblok that handles and simplifies both video encoding and content management. Of course, we don't just keep this plug-in for ourselves: in the future, we also want to offer a license to use the plug-in and the cloud service we developed for it.
#### Codecs, devices and error rates in video-content-management
Using a web service we also developed, our plug-in automatically encodes videos in any number of different codecs and provides editors with helpful feedback on file size and expected loading time for end users. We currently have defined three codecs that cover all common browsers: H264 (for older devices with weaker graphics), VP9 (for Safari and Firefox) and AV1 (as the new industry standard and for Chrome).
Additionally, it encodes for three screen sizes: 768px, 1280px and 1920px, meaning that the optimal resolution for (if you counted, you already know) nine different application areas are pre-rendered. However, defining target sizes is completely flexible, but we find the three sizes mentioned to be sensible.
Video encoding in progress
This leads to an acceleration of loading times of 50-80% (!) on every website, as the respective variant is automatically displayed on the correct output medium. The “Responsive Video” custom block we developed helps with this. In addition, this saves data volume because instead of uploading different versions of the same video and manually attaching different requirements, our plug-in does everything automatically with just one video version — significantly reducing traffic and with an error rate towards zero for editorial team. Video encoding can get very technical – and frustrating – very quickly! - and that doesn't always match the skills of the editorial team - we are proud to be able to contribute to a better editor experience in this way.
When it comes to usability, our plug-in is in no way inferior to Storyblok's content management for images: Videos are integrated into the Storyblok asset system, so you don't have to search in different places. Once a video is selected, a preview is generated. This means editors know exactly what it will look like for users.
#### Recommendations for accessible video content:
Adhering to accessibility standards when creating video content is crucial to ensuring your message reaches the widest possible audience, as accessible video content expands your target group. You can achieve this improvement by adding subtitles and transcripts to your videos. Audio descriptions are crucial for videos with visual elements or scenes without dialogue. Equally important is the creation of sufficient contrast, especially with regard to the readability of the subtitles and the careful choice of color.
Custom video encoder archticture
#### Technical background of the plug-in
When you select a video in Storyblok, the plug-in checks whether the video already exists in the appropriate sizes and codecs. If not, they will be generated immediately. The URLs of compressed videos stored on our own CDN are stored in Storyblok along with settings information. The employed web service remains invisible to the end users. For compression we use FFmpeg — the standard for this task for many years. The exact settings regarding codec and size can be individually adjusted - once defined, they are always played out precisely.
#### Advantages of the Ergosign video encoder
In summary, our plug-in offers the following advantages:
  * Simplified content management for videos and therefore less work for editors
  * Lower error rate
  * Automatic encoding for various output media and browsers
  * Faster loading times
  * Lower hosting costs, thanks to reduced traffic and fewer transfers


Thanks to Storyblok's great flexibility on the developer side, our plug-in was easy to implement and feels native to use in Storyblok. This case shows how flexible the CMS is for developers and the possibility of quick and easy further development to adapt to the needs of editorial and performance. In addition, the plug-in shows that our solutions are adapted to the users and the use case down to the smallest detail.
Do you also have a specific problem that requires more than an off-the-shelf solution? Then talk to us, together we will find a way!

Optimal viewing across different devices, screen sizes and data transfer rates also requires special attention.
The right choice of CMS can be crucial here. In order to create a DXP that is tailored precisely to the customer needs, Ergosign uses various state-of-the-art technologies. This also includes several content management systems, such as Storyblok. This CMS impresses with an excellent editor experience and offers our customers numerous advantages, this includes the fact that content management for images and graphics was appreciated. However, we have found that, as with most CMS, content management and video encoding still has room for improvement. However, Storyblok's asset management for images and graphics is great, which is why we didn't opt for integrating with an external app with an all-in-one approach.
Instead, we have developed a plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into Storyblok that handles and simplifies both video encoding and content management. Of course, we don't just keep this plug-in for ourselves: in the future, we also want to offer a license to use the plug-in and the cloud service we developed for it.
#### Codecs, devices and error rates in video-content-management
Using a web service we also developed, our plug-in automatically encodes videos in any number of different codecs and provides editors with helpful feedback on file size and expected loading time for end users. We currently have defined three codecs that cover all common browsers: H264 (for older devices with weaker graphics), VP9 (for Safari and Firefox) and AV1 (as the new industry standard and for Chrome).
Additionally, it encodes for three screen sizes: 768px, 1280px and 1920px, meaning that the optimal resolution for (if you counted, you already know) nine different application areas are pre-rendered. However, defining target sizes is completely flexible, but we find the three sizes mentioned to be sensible.
Video encoding in progress
This leads to an acceleration of loading times of 50-80% (!) on every website, as the respective variant is automatically displayed on the correct output medium. The “Responsive Video” custom block we developed helps with this. In addition, this saves data volume because instead of uploading different versions of the same video and manually attaching different requirements, our plug-in does everything automatically with just one video version — significantly reducing traffic and with an error rate towards zero for editorial team. Video encoding can get very technical – and frustrating – very quickly! - and that doesn't always match the skills of the editorial team - we are proud to be able to contribute to a better editor experience in this way.
When it comes to usability, our plug-in is in no way inferior to Storyblok's content management for images: Videos are integrated into the Storyblok asset system, so you don't have to search in different places. Once a video is selected, a preview is generated. This means editors know exactly what it will look like for users.
#### Recommendations for accessible video content:
Adhering to accessibility standards when creating video content is crucial to ensuring your message reaches the widest possible audience, as accessible video content expands your target group. You can achieve this improvement by adding subtitles and transcripts to your videos. Audio descriptions are crucial for videos with visual elements or scenes without dialogue. Equally important is the creation of sufficient contrast, especially with regard to the readability of the subtitles and the careful choice of color.

#### Technical background of the plug-in
When you select a video in Storyblok, the plug-in checks whether the video already exists in the appropriate sizes and codecs. If not, they will be generated immediately. The URLs of compressed videos stored on our own CDN are stored in Storyblok along with settings information. The employed web service remains invisible to the end users. For compression we use FFmpeg — the standard for this task for many years. The exact settings regarding codec and size can be individually adjusted - once defined, they are always played out precisely.
#### Advantages of the Ergosign video encoder
In summary, our plug-in offers the following advantages:
  * Simplified content management for videos and therefore less work for editors
  * Lower error rate
  * Automatic encoding for various output media and browsers
  * Faster loading times
  * Lower hosting costs, thanks to reduced traffic and fewer transfers


Thanks to Storyblok's great flexibility on the developer side, our plug-in was easy to implement and feels native to use in Storyblok. This case shows how flexible the CMS is for developers and the possibility of quick and easy further development to adapt to the needs of editorial and performance. In addition, the plug-in shows that our solutions are adapted to the users and the use case down to the smallest detail.

To ensure perfect video content management via Storyblok's CMS, we have developed a tailor-made video encoder plug-in, which we would like to introduce in more detail in this insights article._  
_
#### How did the plug-in come about?
Video content is becoming increasingly important for digital presences as it simplifies processing of information for users and increases retention time. However, video content poses a challenge not only for content creation, but also for website content management. Not all formats and codecs are suitable for online use, and very few browsers are compatible with all codecs. Additionally, the quality and size of the file must be perfectly balanced. Large files lead to long loading times, which can have a negative impact on the user experience and Google ranking.

Yang Zhong
01/02/2022 • 4 minutes reading time
Looking at different aspects of Chinese history, culture and the typical user, it becomes clear why UX design between China and the West is different. Not one approach is better than the other; it all depends on the context and the end user's preferences. It is certainly interesting to look at some of the key differences and where they come from, so let's dive in!
#### About the author
My name is Yang Zhong, and I am originally from China, but I completed a master's degree in ‘Digital Media’ in Germany in 2015 and am now working as Lead UX Designer at Ergosign in Berlin. So for this comparison, I can combine my experience in UX Design with my upbringing.
#### Written Language
To the untrained eye, the Chinese language may appear dense and complex. This is because the Chinese language is logogrammatic and based on written characters. These characters are rectangular and consist of strokes. The number of strokes within each character can vary between one to more than one hundred - yet the character size remains the same.
Chinesische Schriftzeichen
English or German usually require more space to provide the same information, and while Chinese may look denser, it is more efficient when it comes to space usage. This gives designers more possibilities concerning layout options. The results are interfaces that may appear chaotic or too full to a non-native speaker but different to Chinese, whose brains are trained to scan through complex content efficiently.
Chinese and Western Starbucks app in comparison
#### Different developments:
1 Design history
Chinese history developed differently from Western civilization and did not go through the Second Industrial Revolution or experience the Bauhaus period.
Eventually, this has led to a design approach combining Western photographic art and traditional Chinese drawing techniques. This decorative design remains very popular as people appreciate visual details. Global companies usually change the looks of their products to avoid them being perceived as dull by the Chinese market.
Traditionelles Chinesisches Design
2 Economy and business perspectives
China is still developing and growing quickly. The country consists of both rural and agricultural areas as well as metropolises such as Shanghai and Beijing.
These are bustling and may appear overwhelming but also symbolize life, urbanity and wealth. It's similar to visual design, and just as the Chinese are great at navigating through busy streets, they are very skilled at navigating through the 'bold and loud' digital landscape, where eye-catching design increases the customer success rate.
This becomes even more important when considering the large population of 1.4 billion people. After all, a feature that may only be useful for 0.01% of the population will still attract 140,000 customers.
3 Technology and internet
Big tech companies such as Alibaba or Baidu made technology cheap and available to the average Chinese consumer. As such, people have developed their own preferences away from Western tech companies.
As reliable and fast internet spreads in China, millions of new users are being introduced to the internet every year. Product homepages often provide numerous features to attract and retain as many users as possible. An example of this would be WeChat. While it started as a chat tool, it has become a 'mega-app' providing digital payments, social networking, food delivery and more. WeChat currently has 1.12 billion active users every month. So rather than installing individual apps for different purposes, users navigate towards WeChat, which provides everything in one tool.
#### Is simplicity overrated?
Most people prefer products with more assets, functionality and versatility. Chinese UX Design reflects this difference and mindset. Complexity shows status, and 'more' correlates with value. An app full of features and buttons may make the product look good and appear more valuable to the East Asian market.
While the sleek and minimalistic design is often preferred in Western cultures; Chinese average users may perceive it as dull, and the product as less capable.
#### Summary
In this short and insightful article, we have only scratched the surface of differences between Chinese and Western designs and where they may stem from. Context and conventions between both are very different and have had a considerable impact, even centuries later. While globalization has influenced people's tastes and made them more uniform, it is impossible to develop a golden principle that can successfully be applied universally. Companies such as AirBnB might not have failed so hard upon market entry in China if they invested more in adapting their product for the local market.

Nicolas Klein

""English is the hottest new programming language"" 
Vibe Coding sounds like magic – and sometimes it feels that way too. But what does this paradigm shift mean for the collaboration between design and development? We will take a look at the opportunities and challenges – from two perspectives: Nico shares his insights as a developer, and Milena provides the designer’s perspective.
###  From a developer’s perspective
""As a developer, I work with LLMs every day – and since tools like Cursor and Windsurf have been integrated directly into the editor, my workflow has changed drastically. With a single prompt, I can analyze, write, and test code. Platforms like v0 take it even further: I describe what I need, and the application almost creates itself.  
While fascinating, it's also challenging. Because what is quickly generated must remain maintainable and secure in the long run. I often see how the same mindset used for prototypes is applied to production-ready features – and this is exactly where AI Slop occurs: code that works but isn’t sustainable.  
My role has clearly shifted: I write less myself, but I steer, check, and decide more. It’s about recognizing when the AI chooses a poor solution or when a result is not ""good enough."" This only works if I use the tools situationally and thoughtfully – and don’t blindly trust every output.
For juniors, the question arises: How do you learn responsibility in this new reality? AI makes getting started easier – but understanding architecture, being sensitive to performance, and critical thinking are still essential. Vibe Coding changes a lot – but not the need to truly understand technology.""
Created by Carlos E. Perez using GPT-4o image generation.
###  From a UX designer's perspective
""When I think about Vibe Coding, the first thing I see is one thing: new freedoms in the design process. Today, I can directly articulate prototypes – and test them immediately. This saves time and creates space for what’s most important to me: usability, emotion, and storytelling.
The collaboration with developers has also changed. When I bring an AI-generated code suggestion into the discussion, I can present my ideas more concretely – and reduce misunderstandings. Instead of focusing on pixels, I can tell the AI: ‘This button should feel friendly.’ This shifts the focus to what really matters.
Still, I remain critical. AI makes many things easier – but it often repeats familiar patterns. If I don’t pay close attention, homogeneous designs that lack character can quickly emerge. And because the results often look ‘finished,’ it’s important not to forget to iterate and retest the prototypes.
For me, Vibe Coding is not a replacement for UX expertise – but a powerful amplifier. As long as I work consciously, I can design faster and more emotive. But I also know: without reflection, the focus on what truly matters can quickly be lost.""
###  What will collaboration look like in the future?
Vibe Coding not only influences design and development – but also how teams collaborate. What used to happen through handovers and style guides now takes place directly in the tool – as long as the prompts are precise and the results are traceable.
The opportunity: Designers and developers can iterate together in collaborative AI environments – in real time, in a creative back and forth. Handoffs become direct exchanges, and clear roles evolve into flexible collaboration.
For this to succeed, it takes more than just good tools: openness, willingness to learn, and mutual understanding become key success factors. Because Vibe Coding works as a bridge only when both sides actively contribute.
Created by Kevin Stewart
###  Conclusion
Vibe Coding not only redefines tools but also our roles:
  * Developers
  * Designers
  * Teams


AI doesn’t replace us – it expands our possibilities. Those who harness its potential purposefully and understand its limitations can work better, faster, and more user-centered with Vibe Coding.

For me, Vibe Coding is not a replacement for UX expertise – but a powerful amplifier. As long as I work consciously, I can design faster and more emotive. But I also know: without reflection, the focus on what truly matters can quickly be lost.""
Vibe Coding not only influences design and development – but also how teams collaborate. What used to happen through handovers and style guides now takes place directly in the tool – as long as the prompts are precise and the results are traceable.
The opportunity: Designers and developers can iterate together in collaborative AI environments – in real time, in a creative back and forth. Handoffs become direct exchanges, and clear roles evolve into flexible collaboration.
For this to succeed, it takes more than just good tools: openness, willingness to learn, and mutual understanding become key success factors. Because Vibe Coding works as a bridge only when both sides actively contribute.
Vibe Coding not only redefines tools but also our roles:
  * Developers
  * Designers
  * Teams


AI doesn’t replace us – it expands our possibilities. Those who harness its potential purposefully and understand its limitations can work better, faster, and more user-centered with Vibe Coding.

#### What is a Visual Design Report, and why should you write one?
A visual design report is a tool for designers and customers alike - the goal: to get to know new design options.
Writing and publishing this report is an excellent opportunity to engage with industry peers and communicate design ideas more tangibly. The design industry is constantly evolving and changing, so it's essential to keep an eye on trends and reinterpretations.
Our assessment is designed to help identify techniques, technologies, and trends before they become standard. Some of the elements that we mention in our report are already on the verge of becoming industry standards. We list them anyway because trendy can also be tricky, and it takes expertis
#### Tricky Bits
  * Dark themes are not suitable for every use case - even if industry giants like Apple and Google can certainly give the impression with the native support in their operating systems. It's essential to consider the context, environment, and application in which the UI is being used.
  * Thinking UIs in 3D opens up new possibilities for interaction and allows more individuality. 3D characters can greatly simplify storytelling and increase confidence in the application. But be careful: If misused, the style can quickly appear too playful and kitschy.


#### Trendy Bits
  * The reproduction of natural surfaces such as paper, crystal, and glass is currently considered state-of-the-art. Properly implemented, these elements convey a tangible and lasting impression. The feasibility is difficult because development platforms only offer limited visual design options.
  * Flat design has been with us for some years, and several subtrends have developed from this, which we would like to discuss briefly:
    * We've seen Muted Colors more frequently over the past year, and with the introduction of Google's ""Material You"" design language, the supposed trend is well on its way to becoming a standard.
    * Frasurbane got its name from the sitcom Frasier because it perfectly reflects the part of the 90s that impresses with restrained, beige design.
    * Ukiyo-e is a genre of Japanese art that was particularly popular from the 17th to the 19th centuries. Stylistic devices from well-known works of art are now used digitally.
    * '90s Nostalgia might even be trending because many of today's designers are actually '90s kids. This time is known for bright neon colors and designs that almost jump out at you and are therefore remembered for a long time.
  * Anti-Design has many forms, all of which are different and unconventional, sometimes even contradicting well-known design principles and standards. They are also reminiscent of another aspect of the 90s: grunge.


#### Our Conclusion
„Interestingly, these trends are going in two directions: minimalist and reserved in terms of color or strongly reminiscent of the 90s. However, the focus on the user experience is common to all. It's also important to recognize that sometimes trends are just that: trends. At Ergosign, we advise our customers on which style suits a sustainable design or whether an experimental design can underline the image of a product. We think you should take a risk.“

We impressed the UXDA 2021 jury with a virtual reality configurator. Our sixth UX Design Award has confirmed the conceptual strength and innovation behind our in-house project.
The UX Design Award is awarded as part of a global competition for exceptional experience, and is a well-established, renowned design award. This year, we were honored with our sixth UXDA - for a concept for a VR configurator as well as its implementation.
#### What have we improved with our project?
The concept and the implementation are inspired by the needs of our clients. They are expanding their digital offerings, e.g. through online shops or in terms of service design. Due to coronavirus restrictions, the possibilities of online support are being put to the test at the same time.
Paper plans meet their limits when faced with complex concepts, such as planning a bathroom. The spacial context in particular is not there, so well-founded decisions cannot be made.
Our aim is to significantly improve the consulting situation, prevent the wrong decisions being made, and therefore positively impact the customer experience in the long run.
The virtual bathroom
#### The concept takes shape: virtual bathroom planning
#### We are conceptualizing an immersive configuration within the context of a bathroom that is being renovated or newly designed.
The VR bathroom combines digital and analog benefits, as we designed an application with maximum interaction. In our context, this means that drawers can be opened so that the customer can estimate the size of their preferred design features in the final room.
The room should look as real as possible. The devil is in the detail: our VR specialists focused especially on light, shadow and reflections on smooth or wet surfaces.
The Vive Pro. Image: vive.com
#### Approach, specials and technology
A real bathroom mid-renovation served as the basis: no fittings but lots of questions and ideas.
We translated the room into a virtual version so we could then roughly visualize shapes through VR blocking. Our VR specialists then painstakingly designed two versions of the bathroom with various surfaces, colors, lighting elements and details. In terms of software, Blender was used for 3D modelling as well as Substance Designer for surface design. The concept was realized using Unreal Engine 4
We received initial feedback in a user testing with end customers.
#### User feedback: Paper and VR as the perfect partnership!
Testers agreed: the interactive elements, combined with the virtual room, are a game changer.
Plans that seemed good on paper were adjusted after the VR experience.
What’s more, we confirmed that our concept lets our clients come up with hybrid solutions: professionals can make their initial plans on paper. Detailed planning, such as the choice of colors or materials as well as the specific positioning of various elements, takes place in the virtual space.
Other projects that have already won over the jury with their consistent focus on the user include our machine visualization for [Schütte](https://ergosign.de/de/work/case-studies/schuette/) and our app for [Leica Geosystems](https://ergosign.de/de/work/case-studies/leica-sky-capp/).

#### An app for organizing parking space sharing
When evaluating Flutter, a small team of our software engineers came up with the idea of testing the framework on a real project: an app to organize parking space sharing at our Saarbrücken site.
“How good actually is Flutter? Is it suitable for our clients’ projects?” This question brought together a small team of Ergosign software engineers during Focus Time. In order to judge whether this promising framework is suitable for client projects, it first has to be tested.  

By playing the video, personal data is transferred to the operators of the video portal (Youtube or Vimeo). Further information can be found in our [privacy policy](https://www.ergosign.de/en/terms-of-use.html).
Flutter is a Google framework that lets developers develop apps for mobile devices (iOs and Android), web and desktop only based on code.
Theory alone was not enough for this team. They wanted a real use case where an app would be the right solution.
#### The Project
They quickly found the right project idea: the parking space sharing scheme at our Saarbrücken site.  
This lets our employees flexibly organize their way to work: with a Jobticket, a Jobrad bike, on foot or by car. When using the latter, they’re allocated a parking space. Some days, it’s very practical for employees that normally arrive by bike, on foot or by train to be able to use a parking space. In order to transparently show whether this is possible, for example because another employee’s allocated parking space is empty, the team was to use Flutter to develop an app. The aim was to reserve “empty” parking spaces or make allocated parking spaces available to other employees.
Limited Resources, Limited Time? “Lean” and “Collaborative” Are the Way Forward!
As well as our software engineers Dorian, Steffen and Lisa, UX designer Martin was impressed by the idea of developing a parking space sharing app. As the team developed the app during Focus Time, which takes place once a month, he suggested lean implementation of the project and using methods from the book “Collaborative UX Design” by Dieter Wallach and Toni Steimle.
> In the book “Collaborative UX Design”, Dieter Wallach and Toni Steimle present well-founded basic knowledge of collaborative UX design methods in a compact and easily understandable way.
Collaborative UX Design
#### Approach and Milestones
Hypothesis and Theory
The team took a classic approach to begin with, opting for a project hypothesis. Using “how might we” questions, they came up with the following:
Problem Statement
> “We believe that Ergosign employees at the Saarbrücken site that don’t have their own car parking space (on foot, by bike or using public transport) have issues finding a free parking space (buffer parking or parking spaces allocated to absent employees) on days where it would be useful to have that guarantee (bad weather, shopping etc.).”
Solution Approach
> “We can provide a simple and fast-to-access app to help you keep informed about free parking spaces and making binding reservations”.
Metric
> “We’ll know that we’re right when you are informed of real free parking spaces and can make binding reservations.”
As well as HMW questions and their answers, the hypothesis encompasses another important aspect: the proto personas. The team developed three:
  * Employees without allocated parking spaces
  * Employees with allocated parking spaces
  * Employees already sharing a parking space


Each persona was drawn out with its features, problems and tasks; the team focused on the primary persona first of all - “employees without allocated parking spaces”.
#### MVP, Visual Design and Pixel Warriors
In order to use the time in the best possible way, an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was the aim. This offered the most important functions for the employees without parking spaces in the first step:
  1. Being able to reserve a parking space.
  2. Being able to free up a parking space.


The MVP was developed by our intern Sven as part of his bachelor’s degree. He implemented this not just in Flutter, but also the servers and the app’s database - all with support from software engineer Lisa.
Of course, the MVP required a visual design. The team got together with Visual Design Field Leads Nina and Sascha and created a Pixel Warriors challenge.
Pixel-Warriors-Challenge der Xparking-App

#### An app for organizing parking space sharing
When evaluating Flutter, a small team of our software engineers came up with the idea of testing the framework on a real project: an app to organize parking space sharing at our Saarbrücken site.
“How good actually is Flutter? Is it suitable for our clients’ projects?” This question brought together a small team of Ergosign software engineers during Focus Time. In order to judge whether this promising framework is suitable for client projects, it first has to be tested.  

By playing the video, personal data is transferred to the operators of the video portal (Youtube or Vimeo). Further information can be found in our [privacy policy](https://www.ergosign.de/en/terms-of-use.html).
Flutter is a Google framework that lets developers develop apps for mobile devices (iOs and Android), web and desktop only based on code.
Theory alone was not enough for this team. They wanted a real use case where an app would be the right solution.
#### The Project
They quickly found the right project idea: the parking space sharing scheme at our Saarbrücken site.  
This lets our employees flexibly organize their way to work: with a Jobticket, a Jobrad bike, on foot or by car. When using the latter, they’re allocated a parking space. Some days, it’s very practical for employees that normally arrive by bike, on foot or by train to be able to use a parking space. In order to transparently show whether this is possible, for example because another employee’s allocated parking space is empty, the team was to use Flutter to develop an app. The aim was to reserve “empty” parking spaces or make allocated parking spaces available to other employees.
Limited Resources, Limited Time? “Lean” and “Collaborative” Are the Way Forward!
As well as our software engineers Dorian, Steffen and Lisa, UX designer Martin was impressed by the idea of developing a parking space sharing app. As the team developed the app during Focus Time, which takes place once a month, he suggested lean implementation of the project and using methods from the book “Collaborative UX Design” by Dieter Wallach and Toni Steimle.
> In the book “Collaborative UX Design”, Dieter Wallach and Toni Steimle present well-founded basic knowledge of collaborative UX design methods in a compact and easily understandable way.
Collaborative UX Design
#### Approach and Milestones
Hypothesis and Theory
The team took a classic approach to begin with, opting for a project hypothesis. Using “how might we” questions, they came up with the following:
Problem Statement
> “We believe that Ergosign employees at the Saarbrücken site that don’t have their own car parking space (on foot, by bike or using public transport) have issues finding a free parking space (buffer parking or parking spaces allocated to absent employees) on days where it would be useful to have that guarantee (bad weather, shopping etc.).”
Solution Approach
> “We can provide a simple and fast-to-access app to help you keep informed about free parking spaces and making binding reservations”.
Metric
> “We’ll know that we’re right when you are informed of real free parking spaces and can make binding reservations.”
As well as HMW questions and their answers, the hypothesis encompasses another important aspect: the proto personas. The team developed three:
  * Employees without allocated parking spaces
  * Employees with allocated parking spaces
  * Employees already sharing a parking space


Each persona was drawn out with its features, problems and tasks; the team focused on the primary persona first of all - “employees without allocated parking spaces”.
#### MVP, Visual Design and Pixel Warriors
In order to use the time in the best possible way, an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was the aim. This offered the most important functions for the employees without parking spaces in the first step:
  1. Being able to reserve a parking space.
  2. Being able to free up a parking space.


The MVP was developed by our intern Sven as part of his bachelor’s degree. He implemented this not just in Flutter, but also the servers and the app’s database - all with support from software engineer Lisa.
Of course, the MVP required a visual design. The team got together with Visual Design Field Leads Nina and Sascha and created a Pixel Warriors challenge.

## Designing the future: Nostalgia meets modernity
Join us on a journey through the design landscape of 2024 in the new Ergosign Design Report. Innovation and retro designs go hand in hand with new trends such as bold colors — partly fueled by the Barbie hype — as well as the use of various types of illustrations. This year, we see a vibrant mix of creative design elements showcasing the evolution of design across different disciplines.
#### We show you how!
Our short ""How Tos"" provide clarity on the correct use and seamless integration of the trends.
#### Retro revival
Paying homage to past aesthetics, retro design brings a touch of nostalgia to the modern digital world this year, giving users a sense of familiarity. Notably, there is an increased use of folk design, where traditional art and natural elements transport viewers back to past decades. Additionally, the use of pixels is making a creative comeback. Pixel effects in animation, branding, illustration, and web design combine retro with modern creativity, offering diverse design possibilities.
#### A wide range of design possibilities
The trends highlight not only opulent compositions with complex details and illustrations with vibrant graphics, but also the importance of digital collages and the use of highly saturated, bold, and contrasting colors. The former ""Frosted Glass"" trend has evolved into ""Reeded Glass“, contributing to the visual diversity. Overall, this year's trends offer a great variety of combinations to create unique and engaging experiences.

14/11/2022 • 7 minutes reading time
How can you summarize context analysis, Flutter, focus time projects, and a master's thesis in one word? Quite simply: xCollect. We will show you through an interview how this all fits together and what xCollect is all about.
#### The Interview Partners:
  * Martin Roos, Principal UX Designer
  * Nicolas Klein, Masterstudent
  * Dorian Bauer, Principal UX Software Engineer and Flutter Specialist
  * Malita Pradhani, Senior UX Designer
  * Esther Barra, Senior Communications Manager


#### How did the xCollect project start? Which specific problem should be solved?
Martin:   
  
Especially on a business trip lasting several weeks, it is always more challenging to be fully present with the interviewee — because you only have this chance with the person in front of your microphone, giving you their valuable time.  
After dozens of days, locations, and interviews, we found ourselves in a parking lot in Charlotte (USA) on a freezing cold morning for a contextual analysis. At the same time, the wind was so fierce it almost ripped our papers off the clipboard.  
  
At that point, it became clear that the current set-up of a clipboard, paper, pen, recording device, and the like was done. The process of data collection, organization, and subsequent analysis had to be simplified.
#### How did it go from there?
Martin: [Focus Time](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/group-focus-time-22/), making it possible to work on exciting topics outside the project business. Christian and I first used this to develop the idea further. We used our user-centered design process to develop a problem statement, personas, and scenarios. But it quickly became clear that we needed more time for the project.  
  
So we went to Ergosign's so-called ""Innovation Board"", where employees can pitch ideas to gain time and resources internally. And we successfully got support from user research and development. Due to the pandemic, some problems and changes caused our project to fall into a deep slumber. This slumber lasted about 18 months until our Flutter expert Dorian had the idea of using xCollect as a topic for a master's thesis.
#### How did Nicolas come to this topic?
Nicolas: 
#### With which technology was the project realized and why?
Nicolas: [xPark](https://www.ergosign.de/de/insights/2019/article-xparking-app.html) as well as external projects such as the FichtelApp or the [Hamburg Süd Shipping App ](https://www.ergosign.de/en/work/case-studies/hamburg-sued.html), we at Ergosign have a lot of experience with this. Flutter builds on a single code base — once developed, the application will run on Android, iOS, and, with minor adjustments, also for desktop and web, so cross-platform. You can develop pixel-perfect with Flutter and determine precisely how certain elements should look, which was later pivotal for the visual design team.
#### Were there different project phases?
Nicolas:   
We also debated usability issues such as the app's vertical or horizontal orientation or which data should be recorded in which form (mp3, mp4, etc.). After the technical evaluation, the app was merged functionally, which, technically, already worked. Only the visual design still needed to be finished. Our colleagues Malita and Alex supported us with the visual design.
Overview of xCollect
#### What is the final goal of the project?
Martin: 
  * Participant agreements should be available digitally instead of on paper.
  * Interviews are to be recorded digitally on Ergosign company devices and, simultaneously, secured on our servers — key: data protection and security for our customers.
  * Short notes and marking important points during the interview save you the tedious task of noting down the timestamp so you can listen to it again later.
  * Photos and videos are created and displayed in the context of the interview.
  
The transfer, organization, and processing of the data for further evaluation is simplified since everything is available in real-time in an associated desktop app, just as it was recorded on-site.


> Through the collaborative approach between developers and designers at Ergosign, many questions could be clarified quickly. So, I could implement the design quickly and effectively with Alexandra Schotsch. We have noticed again and again how diverse the users can be, which brought up more questions. What do we focus on? was the most common one, as we anticipate many scenarios and different user approaches. In the actual implementation of the design, we were able to draw inspiration from existing in-house software such as xDesk and xPark. A new style element we've included is the representation of waveforms as recurring parts of the design.

#### How is the project now being used at Ergosign?
Dorian: 
#### What does it mean to write such a thesis and develop a project as a master's student at Ergosign?

"https://ergosign.de/en/insights/blog/weiss","Agility towards the Finish Line: Weiss Umwelttechnik - S!MPATI® Online","# Agility towards the Finish Line: Weiss Umwelttechnik - S!MPATI® Online
Kristin Becker
04/11/2021 • 3 minutes reading time
Large, complex projects often require various expert teams to work together. The agile organization of these inter-company, inter-disciplinary teams is a challenge that can only be overcome together. You need a cohesive and open mindset, transparency regarding aims and expectations as well as short decision-making paths so that new requirements and realizations can be reacted to flexibly.
#### About Weiss Umwelttechnik
Ergosign has been a partner of Weiss Umwelttechnik - the market leader for environmental simulation systems for industries such as the automotive, electronic and pharma sectors - for many years. We have already successfully completed many projects together, and we were invited on board for their latest project, “S!MPATI® online” too:
> „As a market leader, we want to constantly develop our product portfolio and have decided to supplement our already high-performance management software for environmental simulations to include a platform-based cloud service. “S!MPATI® online” is a modern, user-friendly platform that combines various location-independent services for the management, planning and organization of tests as well as facilitating the automated creation of test reports.“
#### The Project
Ergosign has been supporting Weiss Umwelttechnik with its “S!MPATI® online” project since it began in mid 2018: it started off as a classic UCD (user-centered design) project with user research and scoping workshops. Together, concepts were validated and the visual design developed. In the meantime, product development was carried out agilely within Ergosign’s interdisciplinary design and development team together with cloud experts from tresmo, technicians from Weiss Umwelttechnik, the responsible project manager and the chief product owner. A strong, self-organized team quickly developed, designing and building on “Simpati Online” services together.
> ""Ergosign supports you in the successful implementation of your agile projects and guides you from project setup through to establishing a common agile mindset and tailored development processes, right through to delivering and further developing your product.""
Kristin Becker
Digital transformation is creating a constant process of change in an industrial context. The result? The number of technically complex projects is increasing, so more and more companies are placing their trust in the expertise of specialist service providers. This leads to more team arrangements where service providers work together with managers from various sectors.
Team structure in the project
#### Test it. Heat it. Cool it. - Innovation ahead
Weiss Umwelttechnik’s solutions simulate various thermal and climatic conditions and are used worldwide in research and development as well as in the production and quality assurance of countless products.
“S!MPATI® online” provides companies with expanded software functions for test reports and test material management. Major added value is therefore offered by location-independent access to customer systems and the automated creation of editable test reports - including graph-based evaluations, written test documentation, test material images and corresponding system logs.
Big data and predictive maintenance will also play a key role in the future. In the long term, the producer-specific IoT platform - alongside the planning, management and analysis of environmental simulations - should integrate further services and products via an IoT gateway and the cloud.
Screen from project
#### Perfectly Paired
Large amounts of data transferred from test consoles must be documented, analyzed and managed in a user-friendly yet meticulously thorough way. The quick and simple transfer into a test report as well as templates for recurring data and test processes save test engineers lots of time.
As a facilitator between all those involved in the project, the design team must always critically question and verify new requirements and changes in order to consolidate them into one concept that increases added value. So all Chief product owner needs, as well as the individual requirements of the front-end and back-end team, are taken into account.
#### Agile Development & Project Management
Transparency and trust are the cornerstones here. An agile approach to suit the project is necessary, ideally combining the best practices of various agile frameworks.
The dual-track approach was a good option here. Designers use known UX methods to work on new concepts and designs based on user stories in close collaboration with the chief product owner as well as software engineers. Prioritized in advance, these are then directly planned into the next development sprint. The sprints are based on the Scrum framework and last 2 weeks, during which time concepts are implemented, retested from a design perspective and finally tested in terms of quality assurance. Product increments are therefore created within a short period of time; these are potentially deliverable and offer real added value.
Questioning processes, requirements and concepts is expressly desired. This increases the commitment and personal responsibility of each individual, while also creating a high level of trust among stakeholders.
Simply introducing agile practices like user stories, product backlogs and sprint boards and working to an agile framework is not enough. The foundations for all agile working are formed by the right mindset with corresponding values and principles such as openness, transparency, courage, focus, and the trust that each individual team member is giving their all to drive the product forward.

# Agility towards the Finish Line: Weiss Umwelttechnik - S!MPATI® Online
Kristin Becker
04/11/2021 • 3 minutes reading time
Large, complex projects often require various expert teams to work together. The agile organization of these inter-company, inter-disciplinary teams is a challenge that can only be overcome together. You need a cohesive and open mindset, transparency regarding aims and expectations as well as short decision-making paths so that new requirements and realizations can be reacted to flexibly.
#### About Weiss Umwelttechnik
Ergosign has been a partner of Weiss Umwelttechnik - the market leader for environmental simulation systems for industries such as the automotive, electronic and pharma sectors - for many years. We have already successfully completed many projects together, and we were invited on board for their latest project, “S!MPATI® online” too:
> „As a market leader, we want to constantly develop our product portfolio and have decided to supplement our already high-performance management software for environmental simulations to include a platform-based cloud service. “S!MPATI® online” is a modern, user-friendly platform that combines various location-independent services for the management, planning and organization of tests as well as facilitating the automated creation of test reports.“
#### The Project
Ergosign has been supporting Weiss Umwelttechnik with its “S!MPATI® online” project since it began in mid 2018: it started off as a classic UCD (user-centered design) project with user research and scoping workshops. Together, concepts were validated and the visual design developed. In the meantime, product development was carried out agilely within Ergosign’s interdisciplinary design and development team together with cloud experts from tresmo, technicians from Weiss Umwelttechnik, the responsible project manager and the chief product owner. A strong, self-organized team quickly developed, designing and building on “Simpati Online” services together.
> ""Ergosign supports you in the successful implementation of your agile projects and guides you from project setup through to establishing a common agile mindset and tailored development processes, right through to delivering and further developing your product.""

Digital transformation is creating a constant process of change in an industrial context. The result? The number of technically complex projects is increasing, so more and more companies are placing their trust in the expertise of specialist service providers. This leads to more team arrangements where service providers work together with managers from various sectors.
Team structure in the project
#### Test it. Heat it. Cool it. - Innovation ahead
Weiss Umwelttechnik’s solutions simulate various thermal and climatic conditions and are used worldwide in research and development as well as in the production and quality assurance of countless products.
“S!MPATI® online” provides companies with expanded software functions for test reports and test material management. Major added value is therefore offered by location-independent access to customer systems and the automated creation of editable test reports - including graph-based evaluations, written test documentation, test material images and corresponding system logs.
Big data and predictive maintenance will also play a key role in the future. In the long term, the producer-specific IoT platform - alongside the planning, management and analysis of environmental simulations - should integrate further services and products via an IoT gateway and the cloud.

#### Perfectly Paired
Large amounts of data transferred from test consoles must be documented, analyzed and managed in a user-friendly yet meticulously thorough way. The quick and simple transfer into a test report as well as templates for recurring data and test processes save test engineers lots of time.
As a facilitator between all those involved in the project, the design team must always critically question and verify new requirements and changes in order to consolidate them into one concept that increases added value. So all Chief product owner needs, as well as the individual requirements of the front-end and back-end team, are taken into account.
#### Agile Development & Project Management
Transparency and trust are the cornerstones here. An agile approach to suit the project is necessary, ideally combining the best practices of various agile frameworks.
The dual-track approach was a good option here. Designers use known UX methods to work on new concepts and designs based on user stories in close collaboration with the chief product owner as well as software engineers. Prioritized in advance, these are then directly planned into the next development sprint. The sprints are based on the Scrum framework and last 2 weeks, during which time concepts are implemented, retested from a design perspective and finally tested in terms of quality assurance. Product increments are therefore created within a short period of time; these are potentially deliverable and offer real added value.
Questioning processes, requirements and concepts is expressly desired. This increases the commitment and personal responsibility of each individual, while also creating a high level of trust among stakeholders.
Simply introducing agile practices like user stories, product backlogs and sprint boards and working to an agile framework is not enough. The foundations for all agile working are formed by the right mindset with corresponding values and principles such as openness, transparency, courage, focus, and the trust that each individual team member is giving their all to drive the product forward.

24/09/2020 • 5 minutes reading time
We have been using xParking — our internal app for booking parking spots — for more than a year in Saarbrücken. Time to draw a small conclusion.
How did the idea for the app evolve? And how are the Google framework Flutter and Collaborative UX Design involved? Read our [first part of the article series](https://ergosign.de/en/insights/xparking-app/) for more background info.  
  
Before the rollout in Saarbrücken, our software engineers Dorian, Steffen and Lisa as well as our UX Designer Martin conducted a field test of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the app with a small user group.
The MVP never consists of all features of a future product. And that’s a good thing!
The test proved to be very valuable, as it allowed them to gather essential feedback early on:
#### An example: what happens if a parking spot is blocked by accident?
Before the evaluation, the MVP did not provide an answer to this essential question.  
But thanks to the feedback provided by real usage it’s now part of the design. Now it is possible to ask for a new parking spot or, at a push, park in the parking garage nearby.
And practice shows: our colleagues love the app!
> “I really appreciate that I can easily come to work by car. Booking a parking spot is easy and fast. Simply useful!“
How well the app is actually perceived has now been confirmed in another study with about 50 employees. Applying a UXQ (User Experience Questionnaire), we could confirm that the user experience is perceived as first-class.
Results of the app evaluation using UXQ from Marie-Lou Wechsler's master's thesis
Also, we found further opportunities to improve the app, which we then analyzed in an Ideation Workshop and during a subsequent validation: How come colleagues do not unblock their personal parking spot when they are not at work? And, above all, how can we change this?
#### Reacting flexibly to special circumstances.
Exceptional times require flexible concepts: Slowly, and following strict hygiene and security measures, our office in Saarbrücken comes back to life.
Our colleagues can safely and unproblematically come back to our offices thanks to our new app xDesk! What is xDesk? [Read on here](https://www.ergosign.de/en/news/2020/news-xdesk.html).
Due to this situation, less personal parking spots are required and more flexible spaces are needed by commuters, which want to avoid using trains and buses.
Thanks to the flexibly designed backend structure, we were able to easily react to the requirements: we use a special config file group to categorize our parking spots:
  * Pool Parking Space: These spaces are available for booking for all employees without personal parking spots, i. e. commuters.
  * Employee Parking Space: They are assigned to one employee. If it’s not used, it has to be „de-booked“ before being available for our colleagues.


During the Corona restrictions, we easily classified all parking spots as pool parking spots.
This neither required a lot of effort by our software engineers nor do our colleagues have to de-book their parking spot constantly.
#### Next: create a positive experience for everyone
We noticed that our colleagues simply forget to de-book their designated parking spot if they do not need it. Unfortunately, this leads to them being annoyed with themselves.
So, to minimize this frustration after the time of Corona restrictions, our team is checking different concepts to remind users to make their parking spot available for others.
And that’s only one step to keep the number of available parking spots high. Further exciting ideas are already waiting in the starting blocks.
