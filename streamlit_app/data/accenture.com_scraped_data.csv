## Accelerated pace of change demands more from payments
The world of payments faces a constant whirlwind of developments from biometric authentication to scan-to-pay QR codes and real-time payments. It's not surprising that the biggest challenge impacting banks' payments plans and investment decisions is dealing with the fast pace of technology innovation.
These technology disruptions are directly related to the changing needs of banks’ payments customers. Both consumers and commercial clients are increasingly demanding more from their payment experiences. Consumers are abandoning checks and cash in favor of digital payments at a rapid rate and commercial clients want banks to provide more value-added services to address their unmet payment needs.
1/3
of commercial clients cite lack of value-added services as biggest pain point from their payment provider
85%
of consumers use digital wallet for everyday transactions, up from 56% in 2022
Unlike their more agile digital challengers, many banks aren’t adapting fast enough to deliver next-generation payment solutions. Last year’s research revealed that 2 out of 5 commercial payments clients already prefer fintechs and bigtechs over their banks for innovative value-added payments services.
Our _[Payments Technology Reinvention Study](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-3/Accenture-A-New-Legacy-Of-Payments-Growth-Report.pdf#zoom=40 "" Opens the PDF full report, A new legacy of payments growth, in a new tab."")_ found that 59% of banks still struggle with legacy payments IT systems and infrastructure, limiting their ability to meet customer demands quickly and affordably. To protect their ground, banks need a bold, forward-looking payment strategy, or they risk losing market share as customers opt for alternative providers for their payment needs. 
The good news is that there is a path forward for banks bogged down by legacy technology and operational inefficiency. Our analysis of 326 banks across 18 markets identified a group of leading banks that operate at a level that accelerates new payment offerings and preparations for new regulatory standards. 
What sets them apart is their adoption of a reinvention strategy. The key to that strategy is a modern digital core that helps drive growth, optimize operations, bolster resilience and fuel competitive advantage. 
> Our research shows that banks could unlock $55 billion in efficiencies and new revenue streams if they embrace a strategy of reinvention and build a strong digital core for payments.
## Navigate a path to payments reinvention
To help banks create a new legacy of payments growth, we analyzed how leading banks shape their payments modernization strategy and technology investments, seeking the best paths forward. Our findings suggest that four key actions can open up a world of potential growth and profit.
01 
##  Move from one-off investments to continuous modernization 
How are leading banks approaching their strategy to payments reinvention? They thoughtfully plan for the future and take a longer-term, more continuous approach, with investments being made incrementally to support both regulatory and customer demands.
51%
of leading banks opt for an incremental approach to investments rather than large one-off investments
1/3
say new products for customers is the primary focus that drives their technology investments
1.5x
more likely to exploit their regulatory investments to develop new offerings compared to other banks
02 
##  Invest in strengthening the digital core for payments 
Leading banks benefit from a mature digital core, which allows them to deploy new payment features in response to market demand and make swift adjustments based on product feedback and regulatory requirements.
#### What is a digital core for payments? 
A digital core is the critical technological capability that can create and empower an organization's unique reinvention ambitions. 
From a payments perspective, all three components of the digital core contribute uniquely—and powerfully—to payment innovation and execution. 
  * **Digital platforms:** Payments applications and platforms that facilitate the flow of funds between parties, including domestic current account payments, international payments, merchant services, card payments and more.


  * **Data and AI backbone:** Powers efficient, personalized payments products and services, enabling cross-sell and upsell opportunities across client and ecosystem environments. 


  * **Digital foundation:** A strong digital foundation is essential for securely running a bank’s payments function and ensuring seamless integration across a multi-vendor ecosystem. Beyond composable integration and a cloud-first infrastructure, it includes a Payments Control Tower that provides real-time visibility into the performance of the payments application stack. 


#### How leading banks strengthen their digital core
What sets leading banks apart is their focus on building all parts of a digital core equally. Other banks in our sample prioritize only a few areas, such as cloud and AI. Especially worrying is their lack of modernization in the integration layer, which limits their ability to adopt new technology and respond quickly to business needs.
Leading banks’ strengths stand out on application integration. For example, when it comes to their intelligent integration practices, 85% use AI, automation and dynamic orchestration for their payment applications, while only 18% of other banks do the same.
[Read our report](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-3/Accenture-A-New-Legacy-Of-Payments-Growth-Report.pdf#zoom=40 ""Opens the PDF full report, A new legacy of payments growth, in a new tab."") for a deeper view of how leading banks have a significant lead over other banks across the digital core components. 
03 
##  Tackle technical debt in payments 
Accenture’s [report](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/consulting/build-tech-balance-debt) reveals that a degree of tech debt is healthy for the balance sheet. But throwing too much money at tech debt can be counterproductive. The research found allocating 15% of the IT budget toward tech debt remediation ensures the greatest return for the investments. This balances debt reduction while also prioritizing future strategic innovations.
Banks need to think about prioritizing investments in payments areas burdened by tech debt to ensure alignment with future growth strategies. 
Our payments research found that the application integration layer has the highest levels of tech debt, affecting more than half of the banks in our study. Core payments platforms follow closely, with 44% of our respondents identifying them as an area of concern.
51%
of banks say the application integration layer carries the most technical debt in the payments tech stack
Banks should also consider focusing their investments on payments areas that have high levels of tech debt and are expected to show above-average growth. Globally, these include consumer and commercial domestic payments, followed by cross-border payments. But even areas with lower tech debt, like cash management and trade finance, are ripe for modernization due to their high levels of manual processes.
04 
##  Leverage generative AI to accelerate payments reinvention 
Generative AI can help modernize payments businesses in many ways, and automation is the first that comes to mind. More than half (60%) of banks struggle with essential technology skills. Generative AI can bridge this gap by optimizing workforce capacity and resources—automating repetitive manual tasks and enhancing human efforts through augmentation. Leading banks have already automated 40% of manual tasks and augmented 39% of human tasks in payments.
But the strategic use of generative AI can go beyond automating routine tasks—it can enable hyper-personalization in payment experiences, uncover new revenue streams and enhance fraud detection capabilities.
Leading banks are selective in how and where they align their generative AI investments, with consumer and commercial domestic payments being the top priority, followed by international commercial payments.
## Why it pays to reinvent
Several leading banks are already reaping the benefits of their reinvention efforts and digital core investments. Based on our analysis, these banks show a 2% increase in their ‘payments operating jaws’—the difference between payments revenue growth and operational costs growth—between 2023 and 2025, enabling them to capture benefits worth $14 billion. 
The time is ripe to take advantage of the opportunity in payments. _[Read our report](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-3/Accenture-A-New-Legacy-Of-Payments-Growth-Report.pdf#zoom=40 ""Opens the PDF full report, A new legacy of payments growth, in a new tab."")_ to learn how banks can reinvent payments to create a new legacy of growth.

# Reinventing the future of retail
5-MINUTE READ
December 10, 2024
We’re witnessing a transformational moment in retail history. The power of generative AI (GenAI) is reinventing how retailers attract customers, operate their businesses and engage their employees.
Retailers who are ‘getting it right’ are investing heavily in upgrading both their digital core and business processes to gain insights and create efficiencies using GenAI. Leaders will reshape the industry by embedding sustainability throughout the enterprise to drive profitability, social responsibility and environmental resilience. Given this rapid rate of change, there is a massive opportunity for retailers of all sizes to capitalize on this moment and prepare for the future of retail. The time to act is now.
## Reimagining how people will shop
Generative AI is revolutionizing shopping by making it a smarter and more personalized experience. Product discovery will shift to social and emerging platforms—disrupting traditional search methods. Large language models (LLMs) will become the new influencers, driving shopping decisions through recommendations.
As a result, identifying how to best link LLMs to a retailer’s product and brand information will be key to whether a brand’s product appears as a recommendation.
Bespoke omnichannel shopping experiences will become the norm with consumers driven to brands and products they trust and value. In-store experiences and expanded channels will be reimagined, embedded with increased localization and a focus on community.
## Reshaping how retailers will operate
In the future, we’ll see functional silos break down internally and externally, replaced by responsibility networks.
AI-driven insights will power real-time decision-making across the organization, ensuring businesses can respond more swiftly to market changes and consumer needs and enabling smaller retailers to become more competitive with larger retailers.
New revenue streams will transform business models while strategic alliances expand across the value chain. Emerging technologies, such as GenAI, will fuel private label innovation and optimize product development.
## Rethinking how employees will work
Technology will become a partner to retail employees in the workforce—where tasks will move from executional to supervisory. Employees will act when decisions fall outside defined automation and become enabled to offer a new level of customer service.
Workers will leverage AI and virtual agents for operational tasks and use data-driven insights to offer personalized recommendations. Self-service apps for frontline workers will also offer greater flexibility while driving efficiencies in stores and distribution centers.
Employees will be value-driven, seeking roles and employers where they feel a meaningful connection.
### Six imperatives to get started
As retailers prepare for the future, there are six actions to take now. While each segment and size is unique, these imperatives will help you assess where to start in your reinvention journey.
Embrace the “era of recommendations"" by strengthening your brand and optimizing products to be discoverable where consumers shop and recommended by LLMs. Use customer data to drive AI-powered personal recommendations, boosting customer engagement.
#### 75%
**of consumers wish they could identify options that meet their needs more quickly and easily.**
Use live data and insights to adapt instantly to trend, market, inventory and consumer factors—dynamically adjusting curated product assortments, layouts and pricing that enhance local relevance and customer satisfaction.
#### 60%
**of companies aren’t using real-time customer interaction data to predict customer preference.**
Develop hyper-personalized marketing campaigns that engage consumers across every interaction. Intensify focus on Retail Media Networks and in-store partnerships to unlock new revenue streams beyond traditional product sales.
#### 78%
**of consumers say it is important for conversational AI advisors to recognize them and remember their preferences.**
Redefine the purpose of the store with interactive, digitally-powered and seamless experiences, tailored to various sizes and locations. Address profitability challenges by investing in tools that will reduce the cost to serve.
#### 76%
**of consumers who have some fun while shopping are likely, very likely or always recommend the brand to others.**
Build resilient supply chains with insights and technology to mitigate disruptions, reduce costs and ensure product availability. Increase transparency across the value chain and optimize last-mile logistics without compromising profitability.
#### $1.6T
**is the average revenue growth opportunity that businesses are missing each year due to vulnerability to disruption.**
Provide tools to enhance employee engagement in all roles, promoting greater flexibility and automating repetitive tasks for better efficiency. Empower employees with upskilling, insights and solutions to provide greater customer service.
#### 50%
**of all working hours across retail have the potential to be impacted by generative AI.**

Julie Sweet sits down with Corie Barry, Best Buy's dynamic CEO, to discuss Best Buy’s remarkable reinvention, from the demise of VCRs and compact discs to the surge in online shopping and implementing generative AI to enhance the customer experience. In an ever-evolving industry, Best Buy continues to transform its retail floors for new realms of technology by managing change and staying ahead in a rapidly shifting landscape.
## Investing in better experiences
Generative AI (gen AI) is shaking things up in the world of customer and employee experience by making interactions smoother, more relevant and more personalized. For customers, gen AI brings convenient self-service options like virtual assistants that give timely and spot-on answers to their queries. And for employees, gen AI tools can offer real-time tips and recommended solutions for addressing customer needs.
But here's the kicker: while gen AI is poised to be a game-changer for many companies—[97% of organizations we surveyed](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/data-ai/generative-ai) believe it's going to be transformative—only 31% have invested significantly in the technology. In retail, Best Buy is leading the pack. The company has teamed up with Accenture and Google to develop innovative, personalized gen AI solutions that enhance the support experience for both customers and employees.
## Best Buy’s Reinvention
### Listen to Best Buy CEO Corie Barry share how the company is reinventing the customer support experience on the latest episode of Built for Change.
[ Listen now ](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/podcast/built-for-change#episode42)
## Convenient, personalized support for anyone who needs it
Case in point: a new gen AI-powered virtual assistant that provides customers with a self-service support option when they shop on BestBuy.com, use the Best Buy app, or call Best Buy customer support. Using the assistant, customers can quickly troubleshoot product issues, make changes to their order delivery and scheduling, and even manage their software and Geek Squad subscriptions and My Best Buy Memberships™.
And, if customers still want to chat with a real person to get the support they need, no problem! The virtual assistant connects them to one of Best Buy’s thousands of care agents who are also equipped with gen AI tools to solve customer queries and issues faster than ever before. The tools assess customer conversations in real-time and provide relevant recommendations and guidance. They can also detect sentiment and use data from calls to prevent similar issues in the future. Other tools automate routine tasks such as navigating knowledge bases, so agents can spend less time searching for info and more time understanding and empathizing with the customer.
> At Best Buy we look at how gen AI can help enable our overall enterprise strategy while solving real human needs. We’re implementing it in very strategic ways across our organization to personalize and humanize the consumer electronics shopping experience like no one else can.
Brian Tilzer / Chief Digital, Analytics and Technology Officer, Best Buy
## Committing to continuously evolving experiences
Best Buy is all about making customers' lives better through technology. Through the power of gen AI delivered at scale, they’re changing the game in customer support. It’s all about convenience, efficiency, flexibility and personalization. Meanwhile, customer agents get to focus on more meaningful work, boosting their productivity and satisfaction.
With the retail world always changing, Best Buy is at the forefront, using the latest tech to unlock the power of people and enrich the lives of its customers and employees.

Julie Sweet sits down with Jan Pilbauer, CEO of Al Etihad Payments, to discuss the UAE’s journey towards a more inclusive and digital economy. At the center of their transition is Aani, a user-friendly, secure instant payments platform that is enabling the country's FinTech strategy.

## Enabling the UAE’s financial future
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is embarking on a bold transition towards an inclusive, digital-first economy that pioneers progress across everything from health and education to infrastructure and science. To power this agenda, the UAE set out to reinvent its financial services ecosystem and position itself as a leading FinTech hub. This presented a huge undertaking, especially considering that consumers in the UAE formerly paid in cash for over 60 percent of in-person transactions.
The first step was to create a best-in-class instant payment platform (IPP) to enable safe, innovative, and convenient electronic payments – the lifeblood of any digital economy. The UAE’s national payments company Al Etihad Payments partnered with Accenture to develop a user-friendly IPP called Aani that would make all payments in the country inclusive and universally interoperable. Since its launch, Aani has seen remarkable adoption—57 financial institutions, over 1.5 million end customers (more than 10% of the UAE’s population), and over 100,000 merchants* now use the platform for secure, real-time transactions 24/7.
As adoption grows, Aani will become ubiquitous in the UAE – fostering an economy less reliant on cash that bolsters economic competitiveness and financial inclusion for the country’s more than 10 million residents.
*Data as of March 2025.
## **A robust infrastructure aligned to global best practices**
Accenture led the integration of more than 40 solutions across infrastructure, security, applications, mobile app and banking systems to build the IPP from the ground up. The platform was built on a private cloud designed to scale to support the growing number of users. Robust application, data and infrastructure security measures ensure alignment with international standards and regulations while protecting users and the UAE’s growing digital economy. Advanced cyber defenses and identity management ensure that only authorized users gain access.
The platform processes hundreds of thousands of transactions daily—simplified through convenient features like payments to a mobile phone or national ID, requests to pay, split bill payments or QR code payments — all cleared and settled instantly.
## **Making the leap to instant payments**
Engaging the UAE’s broad financial services ecosystem was vital to a successful nationwide rollout. We aligned a diverse set of stakeholders—including banks, exchange houses, acquirers, fintechs, consumers and merchants—to a shared vision and purpose throughout the planning, implementation, testing and launch phases, and delivered a series of townhalls, training initiatives, and onboarding toolkits to bring everyone fully along the transformation journey.
> Accenture had the technical expertise, scale and experience to help us lay the right foundation for an entirely new financial services ecosystem.
Jan Pilbauer / CEO, Al Etihad Payments
## The next step in the nation’s transformation
Thanks to a modular architecture, Aani will be continually enhanced with new features, and users will soon be able to complete cross-border payments and transfer money to international accounts.
Future solutions, including advanced data analysis and AI-driven automation will boost oversight and regulatory compliance for financial institutions.
Aani is already supporting the country's growth by making financial services simpler, innovative and inclusive, pushing the UAE toward global leadership in digital payments and increasing the country’s financial stability and consumer confidence. By embracing digital technologies, the UAE is paving the way for a competitive, sustainable and resilient economic future, where fintech and other digital-first industries can grow and thrive.

# Car buying in hyperdrive
Car brand smart wanted to replace traditional auto sales with a direct-to-consumer experience. We brought a new platform to life—and sold out an entire line of cars in 24 hours.

  * Driven by data
  * Destination: tomorrow
  * Other case studies


As car brand 
To do this it needed a marketing platform that offered a true end-to-end digital customer experience as well as the data capabilities to fuel future growth and innovation. With Accenture as its partner, smart took this innovation from idea to launch in 2.5 years—a fraction of the usual time.
Within 24 hours of launching the platform in Germany, an entire line of cars sold out.
Learn how smart and Accenture Song transformed the car buying experience by putting data in the driver’s seat.
##  Driven by data
Commerce is at the core of the new, built from scratch platform for selling cars. It features advanced customizations, multi-medium customer service and connections to offline experiences such as test drives. Users can trigger a purchase at any point and complete it entirely online, resulting in a seamless, immersive experience.  

Users get simplicity but what they don't see is the technology that makes it possible. Together, smart and Accenture created the back-end, leveraging solutions from Adobe, SAP and Salesforce and a custom, serverless, cloud-native front end for greater flexibility.
A decoupling layer makes it easy to add or remove features, while the design system ensures consistency. The platform captures data from many sources in one place to deliver better insights.
##  Destination: tomorrow
Now, smart has a central platform for lean internal operations and a smooth customer journey—as well as a ground-breaking business model for direct sales and a data-driven future. Building both platform and business model from scratch is no small feat—but with a hyper-personalized approach and a new vision for direct sales, smart is accelerating into the future and together we’re reinventing e-commerce.

3-MINUTE READ
## Decades of Fortune® data made simple
You arrive at your desk, power up your laptop and face your first challenge of the day. You need to plot the revenue rankings from 2007 to 2010 for the top 10 companies in the general merchandise industry sector to inform a pivotal business decision. How long would that take?
Now, what if you had an AI-powered tool that could shrink this task to mere moments—one that sifts through years of business knowledge and gathers all the necessary insights from a trusted source and presents it in an easy-to-understand format?
[View Transcript ](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-2/Accenture-Fortune-Video-Transcript.pdf#zoom=50 ""Opens the PDF video transcript, Fortune case study, in a new tab."")
Learn how Fortune and Accenture created Fortune Analytics—a generative AI-powered LLM tool that can sift through decades of business knowledge and present it in a simple, insightful format in mere moments.
For many years, Fortune has rigorously collected and analyzed complex financial data on the largest companies in both the US and the world in order to create the iconic Fortune 500 and Fortune Global 500™ lists. These rankings are a gold standard used by industry professionals and leaders to learn how businesses and industries are rising. Over the years, Fortune has amassed a wealth of data that the company offers through a comprehensive analytics spreadsheet product.
Together, Accenture and Fortune collaborated to transform that business knowledge into a Fortune Analytics™ large language model (LLM) tool—an intuitive, user-friendly, generative AI-powered platform that provides access to insights from the Fortune 500 ranking, other annual Fortune rankings such as the Fortune 1000™, print and online articles, and online video transcripts.
Consolidating all of this rich, insightful and trusted business content into a single platform enables users—especially business leaders and researchers—to spend less time searching for information and more time strategizing and making impactful decisions.
## From complex data to simple language
The platform is powered by Accenture’s foundation model services and proprietary LLM assets and is fine-tuned with comprehensive Fortune datasets. Users can receive useful graphical data visualizations like scatterplots, line charts and bar charts generated on demand by the LLM based on the user request. These are just a few examples of the requests users can ask:  

  * “What are the top 8 companies in the healthcare, insurance and managed care industry?”


  * “Show me a chart comparing 2023 revenue and earnings per share for pharmaceutical companies.”


  * “Plot assets from 2006 to 2023 for each company in the Wholesalers Other industry.”


In just 10 months, Fortune reinvented how users can engage with its business intelligence. The new platform brings Fortune a competitive edge and sets the stage for a potential new business model through an improved user experience. Users can interact seamlessly with knowledge from multiple sources and formats, putting relevant business insights at their fingertips.

# Tracr pioneers trust in diamond traceability
Bringing transparency to the diamond supply chain with a secure, scalable national platform that tracks authenticity from source to store
3-MINUTE READ
## Building consumer confidence with ethical sourcing
A diamond’s journey from mine to market can be as complex as its facets, with consumers increasingly expecting to know the source and ethical credentials of their diamonds, making transparency more than a buzzword when it comes to diamond provenance – today, it's an imperative.

  * A rock-solid solution
  * Unearthing Tracr’s prospects
  * We are making bold moves, together


Diamonds are traditionally authenticated using certificates of origin, which sometimes include geographic origin, and grading reports from gemological laboratories. These documents detail a diamond's characteristics, but rarely trace its entire journey. But what if a diamond could tell you it’s story, from its origins deep within the earth, to its place in an elegant store display?
Tracr, developed by the De Beers Group in collaboration with Accenture, is an industry-first blockchain platform that creates a traceable and tamper-proof record of a diamond's provenance from the source. After diamonds are registered on Tracr at a producer (miner) level, they are assigned a unique digital identity that details key characteristics like carat, clarity, colour, cut, as well as provenance. Leveraging IoT and AI, these identities are securely recorded on the blockchain, meticulously recorded as each diamond moves from rough to polished.
Featured three times on Forbes's Blockchain 50 list, Tracr is significantly transforming the industry by setting new benchmarks for ethical sourcing and transparency. The platform currently hosts a digital inventory of more than 2.8 million rough diamonds, with a combined value of rough and polished stones of US$3.4 billion.
## A rock-solid solution
For eligible diamonds, producers upload a digital scan to Tracr, as well as images and videos of the rough stone as part of the registration process. When a manufacturer obtains a diamond, ownership is seamlessly transferred within the platform and the manufacturer uploads a new rough scan. These scans from the producer and manufacturer are compared and the diamond receives a “Tracr Rough Check” if the scans match, minimizing the risk of substitution as a diamond moves along the value chain.
Cloud computing plays a crucial role at Tracr, providing efficient storage and processing capabilities for vast amounts of data, as well as instant access to the platform for all participants in the supply chain. Through superior encryption and access control, as well as compliance with global security standards, Tracr also ensures all diamond data remains secure and private.
Accenture played a pivotal role in supporting the development and scaling of Tracr. We restructured its technical team, implemented agile methodologies and established a robust governance framework that set a strong foundation for delivery. We improved alignment and communication across teams, fostering a collaborative and creative environment. The interdisciplinary team also tackled critical challenges related to data ingestion, processing rate, automated matching and quality checks to ensure the platform's integrity and efficiency, setting Tracr on the right path to scale its industry-first technology.
## Unearthing Tracr’s prospects
Since its inception in 2018, Tracr has made significant strides in the diamond industry. Today, De Beers registers over two-thirds of its global production by value on the platform. Tracr has onboarded new miners beyond De Beers, reinforcing its position as a platform created by the industry, for the industry. The platform continues to expand, working with key industry players to drive innovation and transparency across the diamond value chain.
Considering the continued global push for ethical sourcing, exemplified by the G7's ban on Russian diamond imports in 2024, Tracr’s ability to provide provenance has become essential.
Tracr’s recent collaboration with Sarine Technologies Limited, a leading provider of diamond scanning technology, will integrate its blockchain technology with Sarine's Diamond Journey™ traceability system, enabling an even more reliable verification process. Together, Tracr and Sarine aim to deliver a highly effective, scalable and cost-effective digital traceability solution to the diamond industry.
Tracr provides the transparency needed to meet consumer and ecosystem partners’ demands and minimize the risk of illicit diamonds entering the supply chain. By establishing a new benchmark in the industry, Tracr is forging a path for consumers to feel more confident that their diamonds are not only beautifully cut, but also ethically sourced.

# Vodafone reinvents customer service using gen AI
How the global telecom company is using a chatbot to transform customer experience for young people
3-MINUTE READ
## Making customer service cool
VOXI, the UK’s mobile network for Gen Z, knows that keeping pace with the ever-evolving language of this generation is vital to staying relevant. It’s a challenge facing brands across the world, and many are turning to technology to seamlessly combine the relevant language with a professional tone for customer interactions. At Accenture, we believe that generative AI (gen AI) and large language models (LLMs) can help by delivering more [human-like conversations for a new frontier of customer service](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-2/Accenture-Life-Trends-2024-Full-Report.pdf#zoom=40 ""Opens the PDF full report, Accenture life trends 2024, in a new tab."").
VOXI mobile —a sub-brand of multinational technology company Vodafone targeting people typically aged 16-29 - has built its brand reputation and customer base on a strong differentiated platform, designed for Gen Z. As standard, social media data comes unlimited on all VOXI packages, as these represent the platforms that their customers spend the most time on. Now, it’s using gen AI and LLMs to power a first of its kind large language model (LLM) AI chatbot in the UK, aimed at making customer service more engaging, useful and fun. It’s the first customer facing gen AI chatbot in the UK telecommunications industry and sets a benchmark for customer experience.
Accenture helped VOXI mobile create the chatbot, using our expertise in AI and customer service innovation to guide development. In the first 6 months since its launch, the chatbot has:
  * Boosted customer experience with simpler and faster interactions.
  * Increased containment rates (percentage of queries resolved by the chatbot without a human agent) meaning fewer customers need to be transferred to agents.
  * Reduced average handling time for customers who need agent assistance.


## Better brand representation
VOXI mobile’s previous chatbot sometimes struggled to understand questions and handle multiple queries. This is a common issue with traditional chatbots that require questions to include predefined words or phrases they’ve been programmed to understand.
Initially programmed using existing brand guidelines, the tone of voice came across as that of a teenager rather than a mobile network operator. The chatbot's tone was refined to balance being both youthful and professional, and informed new brand guidelines to better represent the desired tone for future communications.
Using Microsoft’s Azure AI Studio, the chatbot is built on the Azure OpenAI LLM framework which enhances its ability to understand context and handle multiple queries simultaneously. Development took approximately three months, involving multiple iterations to refine functionality and user interface. Accenture implemented an intent classifier that filters incoming questions to determine if they are suitable for response, focusing solely on topics related to VOXI mobile services.
The chatbot was trained using varied customer scenarios, including different tones and moods (e.g., angry or happy), to test and refine responses and ensure they’re appropriate to the tone of the query.
Regular checks ensure language remains appropriate. A kill switch was implemented, allowing the system to be shut down quickly if it were ever to deviate from expected operations. Alert systems were set up to notify the relevant teams immediately if the chatbot produced unexpected or inappropriate content, ensuring rapid response and resolution.
> As we integrate gen AI into our chatbots, we're not just advancing technology—we're revolutionising customer interactions.
Dave Tainton / Senior Product Owner, VOXI
## Setting the standard for telecom customer service
The chatbot has significantly reduced the volume of chats to VOXI’s customer service agents. Additionally, VOXI mobile employees benefit from reduced routine tasks and improved process efficiency in customer service. More important is the improvement to customer experience that helps drive Vodafone’s goal of becoming the number one mobile network for customer experience.
As the VOXI mobile chatbot continues to evolve, it not only enhances customer interactions through its advanced gen AI capabilities but also sets a benchmark by being the first of its kind in the UK telecoms industry.

Julie Sweet and Margherita Della Valle discuss Vodafone’s reinvention, focusing on how the company is partnering with Accenture to commercialize its market leading shared services operations for industry customers in order to accelerate growth, enhance customer service, drive significant operational efficiencies and create new career opportunities for its people.
IN THIS ARTICLE 
  * Embracing “radical change”
  * A new performance frontier
  * People at the heart of change
  * Other stories


Telco companies face several challenges today that include the rapid evolution of technologies, cybersecurity threats, regulatory and compliance issues, and a highly competitive environment for attracting and retaining top talent. Companies that embrace reinvention are better positioned to weather the industry’s volatility and capture more market share.
Vodafone, one of the world’s largest telco companies with over 330 million customers across 15 countries, is no exception. For over 20 years, we’ve helped them drive reinvention in every part of the company to become an industry leader in customer experience.
Perhaps most notably, Accenture helped Vodafone become a cloud-first company and led the reinvention of its global finance organization with SAP – one of the largest migrations in SAP’s history. We also helped them with cybersecurity solutions and automated self-service and intelligent care systems that streamlined Vodafone’s processes. Recently, we helped the company launch a new gen AI-powered chatbot for VOXI, Vodafone’s award-winning youth brand.
## Embracing “radical change”
So, it was only natural that Accenture would bring its technology and [talent expertise](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/talent-organization), tools, capabilities, and assets to help Vodafone deliver shared services to its industry customers via Vodafone Intelligent Solutions (VOIS).
VOIS—which has been operating successfully for over 15 years—brings together network monitoring, human resources, technology services, finance, and call center operations that used to be managed individually across markets at Vodafone into one shared service center.
Now, after reaching a new level of operational maturity, Vodafone’s new CEO Margherita Della Valle saw an opportunity to introduce “radical change” by offering this model as a service to other customers – all while simplifying the Vodafone organization, developing a customer-focused company culture, and providing new career opportunities for Vodafone’s people.
> We’re excited about the potential of our new commercial shared services organization and the potential to serve not only Vodafone’s own markets but our Telco partners across the industry.
Margherita Della Valle / CEO, Vodafone
## A new performance frontier
The partnership with Accenture not only presents a way to fulfill those goals – but also supercharges growth with higher quality services at a faster pace from initial concept to market availability.
The first wave of work is to improve operational efficiency through ongoing initiatives and the use of GenWizard—Accenture’s intelligent automation platform that has a full-suite of gen AI tools to help deliver IT technology services. GenWizard allows Vodafone to reduce the end-to-end technology delivery cycle, incorporating automation to move rapidly through analysis to deployment. Using orchestration capabilities to enhance coding, standardize documentation, and automate testing, the company will be able to deploy changes more quickly, provide a better customer experience by delivering technology enhancements more than 25 percent faster, minimize downtime, and ensure high service delivery levels for end customers.
##  People at the heart of change
One of the things Della Valle is most excited about is the opportunity this new commercial service will provide for Vodafone employees to train and upskill on new technologies that are rapidly changing and evolving, and for them to be such an important driver of this revolutionary initiative.
“As we develop new services together and open up to new customers, this will give our people the opportunity to benefit from new careers, new skills, a different view of the world,” Della Valle said. “Our employees have an even better experience by partnering with Accenture.”
The organization is also shifting its mindset to “thinking and acting like a partner” – whether it’s with customers, with Accenture, or with other telcos and tech companies as it extends and grows beyond its borders.
One thing’s certain: change will not stop at Vodafone.

# Uber hails a new era for advertising
The road to building a groundbreaking, multi-billion-dollar ad platform
3-MINUTE READ
## Uber’s convenience, now for advertisers: A $1 billion success story
Since its founding, Uber has revolutionized industries by making experiences simple, intuitive, and personalized and by removing friction from the customer journey.
In keeping with their customer-centric focus, Uber set out to deliver even more personalized experiences by revolutionizing another industry: advertising.
With 156 million monthly active users, Uber uses its global insights to create a hyper-personalized ad platform that connects advertisers with the right consumers in the moments that matter.
Picture this: you’re arriving at work on an Uber trip when an ad gives you a discount for your go-to coffee shop next door. Or on your Uber ride home, an ad reminds you that your favorite TV show has a new season coming out next week. (Better buy some popcorn.) That’s the innovation Uber is bringing to advertisers.
Since launching a new Uber advertising division in 2022, the platform has already surpassed an impressive US$1 billion in annual revenue run rate. But Uber’s rapid expansion wasn’t all smooth riding. The ads business was established quickly and had to move rapidly to meet its goals. This quick expansion and growth saw some employees hindered by manual processes, and teams struggled to keep up with the pace and volume of demand from advertisers. That’s why Uber partnered with Accenture to unify its disparate processes and smooth out the barriers that were slowing them down.

increase in speed of Uber’s ad sales process
$1 billion

custom dashboards created to give teams visibility into operations
## A simple approach for a complex environment
Uber and Accenture started by defining a new end-to-end ad sales process globally. Then, as part of a book-to-bill program, a digital solution was built on Salesforce Media Cloud, centralizing Uber’s ad sales operations and consolidating its customer data into one system. The team then integrated other third-party tools into Media Cloud, eliminating the need to juggle multiple tools to do straightforward tasks.
Next, Uber onboarded global sales groups into Media Cloud, moved and modernized over 100 processes in the cloud, and created over 75 custom dashboards to give teams visibility into operations. To facilitate these changes, the team devised and delivered training and upskilling programs for Uber’s sales teams.
> At Uber, customer experience is everything. That focus has been key as we’ve worked with Accenture to accelerate our growth by building the self-serve ad platform of tomorrow.
Bernie Huddlestun / Sr Director, Operations
By managing ad sales end-to-end through a single platform, Uber now saves time and increases efficiency, helping teams focus on business strategy and selling. And the gridlock of manually kept spreadsheets and decentralized systems? They’re in the rear-view mirror.
Uber is now intaking advertising demand 50% faster and the speed of their end-to-end ad sales process has increased by nearly 70%.

For decades, ESPN has consistently delivered captivating and unique experiences for sports fans. Now, the leading sports media company is pioneering something new—the use of generative AI (gen AI) to provide coverage of more sports for more fans.
With generative AI, fans of sports such as professional lacrosse and women’s professional soccer can now access ESPN game recaps for their favorite teams.
> It’s all about adding to the experiences of individual sports fans, in scalable ways, through innovation. Fans want to dive deep into sports content, and generative AI will allow us to expand our ability to deliver that to the widest array and variety of fans.

Julie Sweet sits down with Carlos Torres Vila, BBVAs visionary chair, to discuss BBVAs reinvention, the 117% growth in new customers he has overseen and more. BBVA has found resounding success in reinventing itself for banking in the modern world but bringing about change in a bank with so much history hasn't been easy.
### What BBVA achieved
11.1M
new customers in 2023
65%
of those new customers were acquired through digital channels
100%
growth in digital sales during the last four years

  * BBVA's reinvention Podcast
  * A wealth of customer insights
  * The pay off
  * Other case studies


Since its founding in 1857, BBVA has sought to stay ahead of the times with forward-thinking innovations. In recent years, they’ve focused heavily on investments in cloud, data and AI to create a data-driven, engaging and differentiated customer experience.
This approach has led to significant growth in new customers and revenue, as well as improved efficiency and profitability. The company realized a staggering 117% growth in new customers in the last five years and posted a profit of €8.02B in 2023, the highest earnings in its history.
As part of its ongoing reinvention journey, BBVA partnered with Accenture to develop a new, comprehensive digital sales model. The result? Nearly 50 million customers now interact with the bank through digital channels, and seven out of 10 sales are made digitally. BBVA’s client onboarding process takes just minutes (versus a few days at most other banks), using AI-based facial recognition and text analytics to verify account applicants via mobile app and real-time connections to external data sources to detect fraud.
## BBVA's reinvention
### In our Built for Change podcast, BBVA's David Puente shares how the bank is succeeding with continuous reinvention.

## A wealth of customer insights
These results would not have been possible had the bank not consistently invested in its digital core, harnessing the power of cloud, data and AI to facilitate the rapid development of new capabilities and insights. For example, bank-wide data, predictive analytics and business intelligence deliver a holistic view of the current and lifetime profitability—and likely behavior—of every customer. BBVA is also using Amazon Web Services to create a new global data platform to provide all business units with a unified view of their data and access to more efficient data processing, analysis and insights.
By combining first-party data with new data sources to deliver a step-by-step view of the customer journey, BBVA’s new digital sales model helps the bank prioritize sales initiatives for new customers and cross-sell to existing customers. The new model incorporates strategy and planning, paid media, search engine optimization, marketing automation, analytics, and content production for BBVA’s digital channels to reach individuals in hyper-personalized ways.
## The pay off
BBVA’s reinvented sales model is having a massive, positive impact—including a cost-to-income ratio of 41.7%, one of the best among European banks. It’s also helping the bank expand its footprint in specific countries and regions. For instance, in Italy, BBVA opened in new markets with a full digital value proposition that inspired 130,000 new customers to join in the first year alone—a figure which has risen to more than 450,000 in the time since.
Today, with the tools and talent to support continuous reinvention, BBVA can continue to reimagine what’s possible, driving breakthrough experiences that attract and delight customers and add real value.
